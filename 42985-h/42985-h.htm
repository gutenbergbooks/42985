<h2 id="FOREWORD">FOREWORD</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> would seem presumptuous, even after ten years
of residence in Porto Rico, to attempt to classify the
social problems of the Island and offer suggestions as
to their solution, were it not for the fact that this
work does not claim to be a complete and final analysis
of the situation, but is designed merely to gather up
the material available, and present it in such form that
it may be made the basis of class-room study. The
absence of such a collection of data was a handicap
to the author in his work in rural sociology in the
University of Porto Rico, and this book represents,
in a somewhat abbreviated form, the material covered.
The fundamental principles of sociology are touched
on but lightly, since there are already available many
excellent books presenting this phase of the subject.
It is expected that the instructor will supplement by
references and discussions, using the facts presented
here to bring out the general principles of theoretical
sociology.</p>

<p>It is to be understood that the facts and data presented
here are not to be taken as a criticism of Porto
Rico or of the Porto Ricans. They are merely an
exposition of the social situation as it exists, and do
not differ greatly, either in quantity or character,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">[iv]</a></span>
from similar facts which could be gathered relating
to any country. It is necessary, however, to know
our troubles if they are to be corrected, and we deceive
no one if we claim a state of human perfection
which does not exist. Neither do we relieve ourselves
of responsibility for our own mistakes by calling attention
to the fact that other people have made greater
ones than we have. A frank facing of the situation,
the acknowledgment of whatever there may be that
is unpleasant in a social situation, and a sincere
desire and attempt to make corrections, is the only
honest thing to do.</p>

<p>I have always been optimistic for the future of
Porto Rico. It is an island endowed by Nature with
more than the usual amount of beauty and brightness.
My relations with the people of Porto Rico have been
such as to convince me that they have absorbed much
of the natural atmosphere of brightness and sunshine
which is their heritage, and I believe them sons and
daughters worthy of such a beautiful and pleasant
island home as Porto Rico.</p>

<p>It will be noted that the emphasis in the following
pages has been placed on rural problems. This does
not mean that there are more social problems in the
country than in the towns, but so little has been done
regarding country problems, and the course for which
this material was used as a basis being devoted to
rural social problems, no attempt was made to take
up a discussion of the many topics which might be
found in the urban situations.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v" id="Page_v">[v]</a></span>
Special acknowledgment is made for the material
used from the reports of Drs. Ashford and Gutierrez,
and for the data from the reports of the Insular Bureau
of Labor while under the direction of Mr. J. Clark
Bills, Jr. Some of this material is quoted verbatim
from the reports, and the author does not wish to
claim it as his own.</p>

<p class="center xlarge p6">SOCIAL PROBLEMS IN<br />
PORTO RICO</p>


<h2 id="population">POPULATION</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Island of Porto Rico, covering an area of about
3,500 square miles, had in 1910 a total population of
1,118,012. The population was divided between the
towns and country as follows: Urban population
224,620, or 20.1 per cent of the total number, and rural
population 893,392, or 79.9 per cent of the total number.
From these figures it is evident that the greatest
problems of Porto Rico&mdash;those which affect nearly
80 per cent of the population&mdash;are problems connected
with rural life. Of course, many of the people
classified as rural inhabitants do not fall strictly within
this class, as by urban centers we mean towns with
a population of 2,500 inhabitants or more, and thus
many of the smaller towns, which really have the
advantages of town life, are classified officially as
rural centers.</p>

<p>The population of Porto Rico is 65.5 per cent, or
nearly two thirds, white, 30 per cent mulatto, and 4.5
per cent black. It is 98.9 per cent native and 1.1
per cent foreign born. During the period from 1899
to 1910 there was an increase in the total population
of the Island of 17.3 per cent, which covered an increase<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
of 25 per cent for the native whites, a decrease of 14.5
per cent for the foreign born whites, a decrease of
15.4 per cent for the blacks, and an increase of 10.1
per cent for the mulattoes. The decrease in the number
of foreign born whites is due to the fact that in the
census of 1899 this group included persons born in the
United States, while in 1910 these were classified as
natives. The decrease in the number of blacks is
doubtless due to intermarriage with other classes, and
as a result we have the children of such marriages
classified as mulattoes. If the number of such marriages
were sufficiently great, the births of blacks
would be insufficient to offset the deaths, and the
number of blacks would, in that case, necessarily decrease.
On this assumption we might very well
prophesy that within a few generations the black
population in Porto Rico will absolutely disappear,
and that we shall have an increased number of mulattoes
who, in their turn, will tend to disappear, as
they mingle in marriage with people of less colored
blood, and in time the black race will be practically
absorbed by the whites.</p>

<p>Of the foreign countries represented, Spain, with
56.3 per cent of the total foreign born, leads the list.
Cuba and the other West Indies have 20.5 per cent
to their credit, France 5.8 per cent, Italy 3.1 per cent,
England 2.9 per cent, Germany 1.9 per cent, Denmark
1.6 per cent, while no other single country contributes
so much as one per cent to the foreign born population.</p>

<p>The total number of foreign born in 1910 was 11,766.
The rural population of 893,392 was divided among<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
the races as follows: Whites 604,541, blacks 32,918,
mulattoes 255,923. Thus we see that the great majority
of the rural population is of the white race, due
no doubt, to the fact that the colder climate of the
highlands of the interior does not agree with the hereditary
love which the colored race has for a warm
climate.</p>

<p>The population of Porto Rico comprises a mixture
of bloods and races that complicates the social problems
of the Island. The French, Italian, and Spanish
elements have tended to mix with the descendants of
the Indians originally found here, and to this has been
added in many cases a mixture of the blood of the
colored race, introduced as slaves into the Island.
In some cases the races from the north of Europe have
also mingled, so that to-day it is inaccurate to speak
of the Porto Ricans as a people of one blood, and the
characteristics of the people might be called a composite
of the various race elements which have entered
into the formation of the native population.</p>

<p>The geographical and geological formation of the
Island renders it chiefly agricultural. Little is found
in the way of mineral deposits, and manufacturing
on a large scale will never be carried on, due to the
lack of fuel supply and water power. The climate
is agreeable and has no doubt tended to render the
people less active than would have been the case in
a colder climate. The prevalence of anemia and
malaria throughout the Island has also weakened the
productive ability of the people and has caused the
casual observer to classify the Porto Rican country<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>man
as unambitious and lazy. The loss of vitality
caused by the diseases just mentioned, together with
others which have visited the Island from time to
time, is almost impossible to determine, but there is
no doubt but that the laziness with which the Porto
Rican countryman is credited, disappears with great
rapidity when his system has been freed from the
effects of disease.</p>

<p>The Island imports a great part of its food supply,
although food stuffs of a vegetable nature are easily
produced and might be raised in sufficient quantity
to maintain our present population. The Island is
too small to provide grazing areas for large numbers
of cattle.</p>

<p>The problems of the rural population have been
practically untouched up to the present time, as the
dominating element in the social and political life of
Porto Rico has come from the towns. The rural
people have consequently lacked stimulus for self-improvement,
inasmuch as there was nothing done
to make them dissatisfied with their condition and
lead them to try to better it. A system of rural
schools has been established by the Department of
Education, but not in sufficient number to accommodate
all of the children of the country. The solution
of the rural situation depends upon proper schooling,
a system of instruction which will fit the children for
living better rural lives and which shall not be simply
the graded system of the towns transplanted to the
country. The special problems of the country should
be taken into consideration in working out the course<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
of study for the schools, and specially trained teachers
should be provided,&mdash;teachers who will look upon
their work in the rural school as their profession in
life, and who will make every effort to adapt themselves
to the needs of the community in which they
may be located. A continuation of the work which
the Government has already started to improve the
sanitary and hygienic conditions under which the
country people live, the abolishing of anemia and
malaria through continuous effort, and instruction as
to proper diet and care of the body, together with
instruction as to how to secure the necessary kinds of
food seems to be the only solution to the rural situation.
Certain other problems which relate to the
rural family will solve themselves as the educational
and economic situation is bettered.</p>





<h2 id="THE_JIBARO">THE JÃBARO</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> rural population of Porto Rico may be roughly
divided into the landowners, or planters, and the
wage-earning countrymen. The planters are usually
people who in many ways closely resemble the country
gentleman or squire of England. They are people of
considerable importance in their communities, frequently
well educated and widely traveled, men who
do not hesitate to spend their money freely for their
comfort and that of their families when the crops are
plentiful and the prices good. They exercise a sort
of patronage over the country people who work for
them, many of whom live in houses on land provided
by the landlord. The laborers look to the landlord
for guidance and for advice in practically all matters
pertaining to their economic life, and the planter
usually reciprocates by caring for the welfare of the
countryman to the best of his ability.</p>

<p>Many of the planters, especially such as are located
in the coffee districts, have been badly handicapped
by the partial destruction of their coffee plantations
through cyclones, and by the low price for their product,
since they have had to compete with South
American coffee in the European and American markets.
In addition to this economic disadvantage, the
planters are also handicapped by the infirmity of their
laborers, most of whom are sufferers from anemia, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
few of whom are able to work without the immediate
direction of a foreman. The economic and social
condition of the planters is not a matter of particular
interest to us in this connection, inasmuch as they are
so situated that they enjoy all of the advantages of
an advanced stage of civilization. The problem that
confronts the progress of Porto Rico is to be found in
the day laborer of the country districts. The following
is taken from the book on <i>Uncinariasis in Porto
Rico</i>, by Doctors Ashford and Gutierrez:</p>

<p>"Our patient has been in times past the <i>jÃ­baro</i> and
will be in time to come. As we have seen already,
while all country districts furnish an incredible number
of sick, the great breeding places of <i>necator americanus</i>
are the coffee plantations, and this is the home
of <i>el palido</i> (the pale man) of Porto Rico.</p>

<p>"The <i>jÃ­baro</i> is a type to be well studied before we
essay to interest him in bettering his own condition.
Many have written of his virtues, many of his defects,
but few, even in Porto Rico, have seen through the
mist of a pandemic the real man beyond.</p>

<p>"Coll y Toste says that the origin of the word <i>jÃ­baro</i>
proceeds from a port in Cuba (Jibara), and that it is
composed of two words of Indian origin, <i>jiba</i>, meaning
mountain, and <i>ero</i>, man. We cannot see the necessity
of invoking this port of Cuba with the excellently
applicable philology he gives us.</p>

<p>"Brau says that the term is applied to-day to a
laborer, but that its true significance is 'a mountain
dweller.'</p>

<p>"Our understanding of the term, as it is applied
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
to-day, is a peasant, a tiller of the soil, a man whose
life is not that of the town, and who lacks its culture.
And when we say that a man is a <i>jÃ­baro</i>, we put him
in a separate and distinct class, a class of country
laborers. These people 'live now as they lived 100
or 200 years ago, close to the soil.' The <i>jÃ­baro</i> is a
squatter and does not own the land upon which he
builds his modest house, nor does that house cost him
anything save the trouble of building it. It is a framework
of poles, with walls of the bark of the royal palm
(the <i>yagua</i>), with roof of the same material or of a
tough grass which is used for thatching, and with a
floor of palm boards. Generally the floor is well
raised from the ground on posts, and the family is
truly a poor and miserable one which is content to
have an earthen floor. As a rule, there is but one
room for a family, which rarely goes below five, and
whose upper limit is measured by the accommodation
afforded for sleeping. The cooking is done under a
shed on a pile of stones. Weyl says that the house
should be valued at about $20.</p>

<p>"The food of the <i>jÃ­baro</i> is poor in fats and the proteids
are of difficult assimilation, being of vegetable
origin, as a rule.</p>

<p>"He arises at dawn and takes a cocoanut dipperful
of <i>cafÃ© puya</i> (coffee without sugar). Naturally, he
never uses milk. With this black coffee he works till
about twelve o'clock, when his wife brings him his
breakfast, corresponding to our lunch. This is composed
of boiled salt codfish, with oil, and has one of
the following vegetables of the island to furnish the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
carbohydrate element: banana, platano, Ã±ame, batata
or yautia.</p>

<p>"At three in the afternoon he takes another dipperful
of coffee, as he began the day. At dusk he returns
to his house and has one single dish, a sort of stew,
made of the current vegetables of the island, with rice
and codfish. At rare intervals he treats himself to
pork, of which he is inordinately fond, and on still
rarer occasions he visits the town and eats quantities
of bread, without butter, of course.</p>

<p>"Of all this list of country food there are only three
elements that are bought&mdash;rice, codfish, and condiments.
Rice is imported from the United States and
codfish from Nova Scotia. The bread he eats on his
visits to town is made of American flour.</p>

<p>"This is a normal <i>jÃ­baro</i> diet. With the wage paid
him he can get no better, but aside from this he is
wedded to cheap bulky foods, chiefly for reasons to be
stated, and is completely ignorant of the importance
of certain foods which any hygienist would like to add
to his bill of fare. If the normal food of the <i>jÃ­baro</i>, as
stated, were his usual food, it would not be so serious
a matter, nor would the <i>jÃ­baro</i> complain so bitterly of
his wretched ration, but the fact is he does not get the
menu detailed above save when he can be said to be
prosperous. Only a few cents difference in wages will
cut out the small proportion of animal proteids he obtains,
the codfish, and a cyclone will drive him in sheer
desperation to the town.</p>

<p>"Aside from all this, if wages were better, it is said,
he would leave his ration as it now is and spend his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
surplus otherwise. This has not been given, however,
a very earnest trial. He takes also more rum than
he is given credit for by those who have accepted the
formula that the <i>jÃ­baro</i> does not drink, but it is true
that he is not usually intemperate in this sense. One
of his vices is <i>la mascaura</i> (the wad of tobacco), and
he believes the juice of the tobacco to be beneficial
in warding off tetanus.</p>

<p>"The <i>jÃ­baro</i>, mountain bred, avoids the town whenever
possible, avoids the genteel life of a civilization
higher than that of his own. He instinctively tucks
his little hut away in the most inaccessible spots; he
shrinks from the stranger and lapses into stolid silence
when brought face to face with things that are foreign
to his life. He does this because he has been made to
feel that he must do all that he is told to do by established
authority, and he knows that this authority
never takes the trouble to look for him unless it expects
to get something out of him; because he is
suspicious of outsiders, having been too often led
astray by false prophets and disappointed by broken
promises; because he realizes that he is not a free
agent anywhere save in the mountain fastnesses. In
other words, he seeks liberty in his home, freedom from
the constant repression of those he recognizes as his
superiors, and exemption from a repetition of deceptions
that have been so often practiced upon him.
He has always been made to stay strictly in his class,
in the <i>jÃ­baro</i> class. Frequently when he tries to express
himself he is laughed down, frowned down, or
growled down. '<i>Tu eres un jÃ­baro</i>' is not a term of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
reproach exactly, but it means 'You are not in a position
to express yourself, for you are only a mountaineer.
You know nothing of our world; you are still a child.
Your place is under the shade of the coffee tree; the
mark you bear is clear to everyone; you are a <i>jÃ­baro</i>.'
Thus there is a great difference between the <i>jÃ­baro</i> and
those who are not <i>jÃ­baros</i>, <i>i.e.</i>, those who live in towns
or those who command in the country. This distinction
is neither made unkindly nor roughly. All
the Porto Rican people are kindly and they love their
<i>jÃ­baros</i>, but nevertheless they treat them as though
they were children. And the <i>jÃ­baro</i> loyally follows his
educated, emancipated fellow citizen, perfectly satisfied
to be guided as the latter sees fit.</p>

<p>"Much of this guidance is excellent, and it is not our
mission to seek to break down barriers which to-day,
may be needful. The <i>jÃ­baro</i> is respectful and obedient,
fearful of the law and never defiant of his superiors;
he is generous to a fault, sharing with any wayfarer
his last plantain; he is devoted to his family and to
his friends. Had he been ill treated by the educated
and controlling class in the island he would be sullen
and savage, but this has not been the case. If it is
true that the <i>jÃ­baro</i> is in many ways differentiated from
the upper classes, it is equally true that there is no
masonry so strong as that existing among the <i>jÃ­baros</i>
of Porto Rico. Bound to each other by the most
intricate ties of relationship and by a still more potent
one, the eternal bond conferred by the title <i>compadre</i>
or godfather, they share their troubles and shield each
other as though they belonged to one great family.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
It is really wonderful to see how quickly and with what
complete self-abnegation an orphaned child or widowed
mother is gathered into some poor neighbor's hut and
there cared for. For these very same reasons search
for a miscreant in the mountains is a formidable undertaking.
On inquiry no one knows him, never saw him,
never even heard of him, and the closest scrutiny of their
faces will not detect the faintest trace of interest or
even of intelligence.</p>

<p>"Care must be taken in deducing facts from questioning
a group of <i>jÃ­baros</i> even in the most unimportant
matters. They are tremendously suspicious and generally
let someone among them who is <i>leido</i> (one who
has established a local reputation for worldly wisdom)
speak for them. One can be pretty sure that the rest
will say 'amen' to all of his remarks. It is said that
this deep suspicion of a strange investigator proceeds
from the methods employed by the Spanish <i>guardia
civil</i> or rural guard, to run down those suspected of
unfaithfulness to the administration, petty infringement
of the law, etc.</p>

<p>"The <i>jÃ­baro</i> is equally superstitious and very quickly
impressed by a supernatural explanation of any phenomena
he cannot understand. The more outlandish
the explanation of a disease the better he likes it,
and for this reason the <i>curandero</i> or local charlatan is so
popular and powerful in the mountains. We very
much fear that our abrupt tumbling in the dust of an
ancient explanation of his for anemia, our assertion
that it was due to 'worms' and our administration of
'strong medicine' which practically put him <i>hors de</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
<i>combat</i> for the day, accounts for part of our early success.
In spite of this lack of knowledge of the world
above him he has one quality which is his ever ready
defense, his astuteness. There is one phrase much
used in describing the <i>jÃ­baro's</i> acuteness of observation.
Referring to a trade it is said: '<i>Para un jÃ­baro, otro,
y para los dos, el demonio</i>,' which means, 'To get the
best of a jÃ­baro, employ another, and to catch both,
Satan himself must take charge of them.'</p>

<p>"This astuteness, despite all of the great obstacles
in the path of our work among them, was what chiefly
led to success in bringing these people under treatment.
They soon saw that we got results, and with a fact
capable of sensational proof in our hands, the <i>jÃ­baro</i>
accepted us and we joined the 'order' to which we
have made reference. From that time he has been
our friend, and better friends no man ever had, for
his entire support is given us; he preaches our 'new
medicine' and wherever we have expounded these
things to him by word of mouth and by virtue of
proof he takes pride in explaining, better than any
representative of the upper classes, how the disease
is acquired and how it may be prevented.</p>

<p>"The prime fact, however, is that he has, until
recently, been much neglected, neglected by those who
are not of his class, neglected by the authorities.
There are municipalities whose town forms but a
tenth of the population of the outlying country,
whose taxes are collected to support it, yet which
seem to forget the submerged mass in the mountains.
This being so for the towns which are surrounded by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
these people, how attenuated the interest becomes in
the capital and larger cities of the island, and how
extremely diluted that of the continental American
who neither knows his needs nor even what <i>jÃ­baro</i>
means.</p>

<p>"Education will transform this <i>jÃ­baro</i> into something
much better or much worse, for he will not
remain content as he is when he can read, write, and
see the world with his own eyes. In this education
the respect he bears his more fortunate compatriots,
the power for good they have over him, and the confidence
he reposes in them must be preserved. The
labor he must perform to enrich the island must be
dignified by his employer and by himself, or else the
hills will be deserted and the <i>jÃ­baro</i> will become a
vicious hanger-on of towns. Better homes, better
means of communication with towns, now becoming
an accomplished fact, better food, education, in which
remarkable progress is being made at this day, better
habits of life, especially in the modern prevention of
disease, must form a part of any plan adopted to
improve his condition. The planter who to-day sees
the laborer must see in him the man whose bodily,
mental, and moral development will make the plantation
a success. The planter is the man of all men in
Porto Rico who must begin to help the <i>jÃ­baro</i> upward
in order to emerge from his own present industrial
depression. This lack of mental contact, of a common
ground of interest between the <i>jÃ­baro</i> and the better
class of Porto Ricans drives the former to charlatans
for his medical advice, to the wild fruits and vegetables
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
of the interior for his food, and to weird creeds for
his religious comfort.</p>

<p>"His dependency causes him to look for protection,
for direction and for ideas from the planter, from the
municipality, and from the Insular Government. He
considers himself a ward of his employer and of those
placed in authority over him. He does not care to
accept any responsibility for the simple reason that
he has always been made to feel that he is not a responsible
person. Therefore, how can we blame him
when we find him without shoes, knowing that by
wearing them he will protect himself against a dangerous
infirmity; without bacon and corn, without household
furniture, with but one room for his entire family.</p>

<p>"It is a specious excuse, nothing more nor less, which
avers that the <i>jÃ­baro</i> is born the way he is and cannot
be changed at this late day, that we must await a new
generation, etc. On that principle we could expect
very little from the antituberculosis crusades in New
York. The truth is that to change the <i>jÃ­baro</i>, we
must convince him that he will be bettered by the
change, and he is sharp enough to change then, but
the gist of all is that these changes must be begun by
the men to whom the <i>jÃ­baro</i> has always looked for
light, and this means good hard work and much perseverance,
tact, and genuine personal interest. From
our acquaintance with the men to whom this burden
will fall we should say that they are not only sufficiently
good business men to realize the benefit they would
get out of a healthy laboring class, but that the innate
patriotism of the Porto Rican agriculturist and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
deeper underlying sympathy for his <i>jÃ­baro</i> will some
day bring about reforms that they alone can make
possible.</p>

<p>"Agricultural laborers, in spite of the small wages
they receive, are nearly if not quite as expensive as
those in the United States, for with 50 per cent less
of efficiency from disease and wasteful methods of
work, the difference in wage is of small advantage.
Weyl states:</p>

<p class="i2">'The small equity which the planter holds in the estate which
he cultivates does not permit him to pay any higher wages, and
the poverty of the planter prevents him from making the outlay
necessary for the proper cultivation of his land.'</p>

<p>"Few coffee planters have anywhere near a reasonable
amount of their land under cultivation for the
reason that with the poor help and methods now existent
they are unable to extend their plant. The regular
labor, employed all the year round, the peons&mdash;who
form a relatively small percentage of the entire number
available for work&mdash;are paid for a full day's work,
and their degree of anemia is such as to prevent their
doing but about 50 per cent of what they are paid for
doing. Our estimate of the relative efficiency of labor
was made from what the planter himself told us and
by a simple experiment which we tried upon about
500 adult workers in different parts of the interior.
We questioned each one as to the amount of coffee he
could pick in a day and found that from two to three
<i>almudes</i> was the utmost the majority could do, and
that one <i>almud</i> was too much for many. Some stated
that after picking a sack full in a remote part of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
plantation they were unable to get it in to the mill
without a mule, on account of the fact that their
limbs refused to bear them up. When these people
were working at light work, and at a time when the
more they picked, the greater the profit to themselves,
is it reasonable to suppose that when working for a
wage without this incentive this 50 or 60 per cent labor
would be any more efficient? This reduction in laboring
capacity demonstrates what a heavy toll is paid
by both employer and employee to uncinariasis in
Porto Rico.</p>

<p>"As to absentee landlords, Weyl says:</p>

<p class="i2">'Many of the absentee owners of Porto Rican properties
and many of their agents in Porto Rico consider the island and
its population as equally fit for the crassest exploitation, and
are as contemptuous of the people as they are enthusiastic about
the island. The current use by many Americans of an opprobrious
epithet for Porto Ricans bespeaks an attitude which takes
no account of the human phase of the problem, but considers the
population as composed merely of so many laborers willing to
work for such and such a price.'</p>

<p>"Thus the poor laborer, his earning capacity cut
down by his disease, with employment which is at
best very irregular, with his sick wife and children
for whom he has to buy 'iron tonics' that cost all that
he can rake and scrape together, without money for
clothes, much less for shoes, with a palm-bark hut
not too well protected against the damp cold of the
grove in which he lives, with not a scrap of furniture
save, perhaps, a hammock, and, worst of all, with a
miserable diet lacking in proteids and fats, lives from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
day to day, saving nothing, knowing nothing of the
world beyond his plantation, working mechanically
simply because he is not the drone he has been too
frequently painted outside of Porto Rico, but without
any object save to keep on living as generations have
done before him. It has been our experience that
when he is asked 'Why have you sought our dispensary?'
the answer has almost invariably been,
'Because I can no longer work.' The <i>jÃ­baro</i>, nevertheless,
has ever been the lever which has raised the
bank account of Porto Rico, and with an average of
40 per cent of hemoglobin and two and a half millions
of red corpuscles per cubic millimeter he has labored
from sun to sun in the coffee plantation of the mountains,
in the sugar estate of the coast land, and in the
tobacco field of the foothills, in addition to his personal
coÃ¶peration in other industries and commercial
enterprises. He is a sick man and deserves our highest
respect, and merits our most careful attention as a
vital element in the economic life of the island. The
American people should take seriously into account
his future, which is at present anything but promising."</p>


<h2 id="OVERPOPULATION">OVERPOPULATION</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">When</span> we say that a country is overpopulated we
speak in relative terms, inasmuch as the overpopulation
of a country does not depend upon the density of the
population alone, but also upon the ability of that
country to produce a sufficient amount of foodstuffs to
maintain its population. Thus a country which has a
relatively small population and a still smaller ability
to produce foodstuffs would be more overpopulated
than a country of similar size with a larger population
and a still greater production of foodstuffs.</p>

<p>In considering the case of Porto Rico, we find that
the Island contains 8,317 square kilometers of land.
The estimated population at the present time is
1,200,000. This gives about 140 persons to the
square kilometer as compared with 72 persons in
France, 237 persons in Belgium, and 252 in Saxony.
If the productive ability of the soil of Porto Rico is
as great as that of Belgium and Saxony, we must
conclude that Porto Rico is not overpopulated. If
for any reason it is less, then the extent of overpopulation
increases directly as the soil grows less in productive
ability.</p>

<p>Porto Rico has about ten times as many inhabitants
per square acre as the average throughout the United
States; but the conditions of climate do a great deal
to equalize this difference. In the first place, the soil
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
is available in Porto Rico for the production of crops
throughout the twelve months of the year, whereas
in parts of the United States and in northern Europe
the soil is usable for only a portion of the year on
account of its unproductive condition during the
winter months. Another matter that must be taken
into consideration in the question of overpopulation,
is the severity of the climate. Where the climate is
severe, the country will maintain in comfort a much
smaller population than where the climate is as friendly
to the human race as we find it in Porto Rico.</p>

<p>Of the population of Porto Rico in 1910, about 75
per cent lived in communities that had less than 500
inhabitants, showing conclusively that the great majority
of the people of Porto Rico should be classified
as rural inhabitants and that the problems which
affect the rural people of Porto Rico are the problems
which would affect, to a great extent, the entire Island.
Only two cities in the Island have a population of more
than 25,000, while only 30 would fall under the head
of urban territory, that is, towns which have a population
of 2,500 or more.</p>

<p>The rate of increase of population in Porto Rico is
far in excess of the rate of increase in the United States,
and this is one of the things that must be taken into
consideration in considering the question of overpopulation.
In the United States the rate of increase
among the class of people whose salaries range from
$700 to $2,500 is from ten to twelve per thousand.
In Porto Rico, the rate of increase is about twenty per
thousand.</p>

<p>Thus we see that the rate of increase of the population
of Porto Rico is much greater than that of the United
States. When we take into consideration the advancement
being made in sanitary science in Porto<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
Rico and in the elimination of disease, as well as the
increased facilities for caring for sickness, we may
expect that the rate of increase here will be augmented
each year.</p>

<p>The general opinion is that Porto Rico is so thickly
populated that a crisis is inevitable, unless some means
is found for remedying the present situation. It does
not seem, however, that we are justified in coming to
such a conclusion when we consider the much more
densely populated countries of Belgium and Saxony.
Increased production of the soil due to intensive agriculture,
and modern methods of farming, as well as
the breaking up of the land into small farms, have
been the means of taking care of the vast populations
of European countries where climatic conditions are
not as favorable as they are in Porto Rico. Of the
total acreage of Porto Rico about 94 per cent is in
farms, and we find that only 30,000 people are directly
dependent upon these farms for their support. Of the
total number of acres included in farm land, about
75 per cent is improved and under cultivation, so that
there is still about one quarter of the land that can
be devoted to agriculture when it has been connected
with markets, or by other means rendered available for
this purpose. There are in Porto Rico more than
58,000 farms, 46,779 of which are operated by their
owners. These, in the great majority of cases, are
small farms and are of the kind which bring the greatest
amount of benefit to the Island. Some 10,000
farms are operated by tenants, and these farms also
are usually small.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

various sizes in the Island to-day:</p>

<p>Of the owners and tenants of these farms 44,521 are
white and 13,850 are colored. About 95 per cent of
all the owned farms are free from mortgage. The
average size of the farms in Porto Rico is about 35Â¾
acres.</p>

<p>The experience of European countries has been that
large farms, in a densely populated country are detrimental
to the community welfare, because the holding
of such farms by a few condemns a large percentage
of the population to a dependent condition. As the
number of farms decreases, the number of salaried
laborers must increase, and as this floating population
increases, there is also a tendency for crime to increase,
as the man who has no responsibilities as a proprietor
of land often lacks the fundamental stimulus to make
him observe the laws of his country. The landowner,
having obtained even a small parcel of land, has an
incentive for hard work, wishing to better his financial
condition, while the dependent salaried man, with no
visible stimulus for saving, tends to spend his money
as fast as it is earned and seldom accumulates any
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
property. To such an extent is the possession of
land regarded as a benefit to the individual and an
incentive toward good citizenship, that in some European
countries the government has made arrangements
to loan money to worthy young men for the purchase
of small farms on the ground that the government
gains a desirable citizen every time that it creates
a landholder. The Government of Porto Rico might
well take some steps to encourage dependent laborers
to accumulate property, either by means of loans to
those who desire to purchase property, or by opening
up government land for settlement under the Homestead
Act.</p>

<p>The rise in the price of land and the fact that the
greater part of the land of Porto Rico is devoted to
industries which are most productive when conducted
on a fairly large scale, has tended to the accumulation
of large tracts of land, and legal measures should be
enacted against the accumulation of tracts of land of
more than 100 or 200 acres, and providing for the distribution
of any large tracts in case of the death of
the present owner:</p>

<p>At the present time a good deal of the foodstuffs
of Porto Rico is imported into the Island while
if there were more widely extended division of the
land into a large number of small farms, the production
of these foodstuffs could be greatly increased,
although, of course, this would tend to decrease the
production of certain other crops which at present
claim the chief attention of the people of Porto Rico.</p>

<p>According to the Report of the Governor of Porto<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
Rico for 1914-15, the division of land among the
various industries, as well as the average value per

<p>From this table we see that certain industries, such
as the cultivation of pineapples or citrus fruits, which
can be carried on successfully on relatively small farms,
bring practically as high a return per acre as does the
production of sugar cane, which is essentially a large
farm product. This argument would not necessarily
do away with the cultivation of sugar cane, but would
tend to increase the cultivation of other crops wherever
and whenever the soil and climatic conditions would
permit.</p>

<p>An increase in the number of owned farms and a
consequent decrease in the number of dependent wage
earners, together with the increased production of
foodstuffs which such a system of land management
would necessarily bring as a result, providing the
management of the farms was carried on under modern
scientific methods, would, to a great extent, relieve
the situation of overpopulation which we now face.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
Porto Rico can support twice the population which
she now has with comparative ease, providing some
means is found to relieve the economic situation of
the greater part of the people and to prevent the
accumulation of wealth in the hands of a comparatively
small number. It is estimated at the present
time that the wealth of Porto Rico is in the hands of
less than 15 per cent of the population, and the remaining
85 per cent are dependent for their living
upon daily or monthly wages. Such a situation must
be changed or else the question of overpopulation
will become indeed serious. There is no particular
reason to fear that the population will increase to such
an extent that we shall be unable to support ourselves
on what the Island may produce; but with the increase
of population under present conditions, trouble between
capital and labor and between workmen and
their employers cannot be avoided.</p>

<p>Emigration as a means of relief to the overpopulation
of Porto Rico will not solve the question. In the
first place, the Porto Rican people are essentially a
home-loving people, clinging closely to family ties and
not at all disposed to migrate to other countries. A
few cases of Porto Rican families who have moved to
other countries have shown that in the majority of
instances the migration was not successful. In the
second place, in order to relieve the situation at all
it would be necessary to provide for the emigration of
a large number of families. The removal of 100 or
500 families from Porto Rico would not make any
appreciable difference in the economic situation that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
we find to-day. The average family consists of five
people, and the removal of 5,000 unskilled laborers
from the Island would not tend to relieve the situation.</p>

<p>The only means of meeting the situation of overpopulation
is through increasing the food production
of the Island by means of division into small farms,
intensive cultivation, and modern methods of farming.
The school must do its share in the teaching of small-farm
and garden farming, and the Government should
assume the responsibility for fostering the increase
of the number of small farms as well as for assisting
in the educational work to improve the methods of
cultivation.</p>



<h2 id="THE_FAMILY">THE FAMILY</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> family is the simplest combination of individuals
that we find in organized society and is the basis of
social group forms. It ranks in importance as a social
institution with the church, the state, and the school,
coming into existence before any of these three institutions.
It existed in a complete form, consisting
of father, mother, and children long before there was
such an institution as civil or religious marriage.
In the history of mankind, the family and marriage
grew up together, the importance of the family requiring
certain marriage customs by which the members of
the family could be held together to protect the interests
of the children.</p>

<p>In Porto Rico we find the average family consisting
of five people, and according to the census of 1910,
in the total population 15 years of age and over, 43.7
per cent of the males and 38 per cent of the females
were single; 36.2 per cent of the males of the total
population and 35.4 per cent of the females were
married, while 16 per cent of the males (or a total of
50,113), and 15.7 per cent of the females (or a total
of 51,073), were consensually married, that is, living
together by mutual consent, but without the benefit
of a civil or ecclesiastical marriage.<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> This proportion
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
is somewhat lower than it was in 1899, as the percentage
of consensual marriages in comparison with
the population at that time was 16.3 per cent for the
males and 15.2 per cent for the females. The difference,
however, does not exceed one half of one per
cent, and there were actually 17,046 more people living
together consensually in 1910 than in 1899. The seriousness
of the situation may be seen when we consider
that of the total population of the Island over 15 years
of age, 31.7 per cent, nearly one third, representing
101,186 people, are living together without any form
of marriage ceremony.</p>

<p>Many reasons have been given for the prevalence of
the consensual marriage in Porto Rico, among which
are to be found the necessity of the ecclesiastical marriage
with its complicated forms and the relatively
costly ceremonies which prevailed before the institution
of civil marriage under the American Government.
It seems quite probable, however, that this custom is
a relic of the consensual marriage form, which was
established by the early colonizers of Porto Rico, many
of whom came to the Island, leaving their families
behind, and entered into consensual marriage relations
with the native women of the Island. In this way the
custom was established, and there was a lack of public
opinion against it which has existed down to the present
time, and until, through the influence of the schools,
public opinion against this form of union can be roused,
very little progress will be made in changing conditions.</p>

<p>There is no doubt but that many of the consensual
marriages are considered by the parties concerned just
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
as permanent as those performed by civil or ecclesiastical
authorities, and the question of immorality does
not enter into their view of the situation. It is a
question of mutual consent, and especially in the
country districts, the knowledge of the law in regard to
these matters is very vague. The greatest harm in
cases of marriage of this sort lies in the tendency to
prevent the spread of public opinion against the custom
and in the ease with which the family relations
can be broken at the will of either member of the
family, with the resulting unprotected condition of
the children which may have been born into the
family.</p>

<p>The number of persons of illegitimate birth in the
Island of Porto Rico, as given by the census of 1899
and that of 1910, is as follows:</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="5" summary="illegitimate">

<tr>
  <td class="tdl">White illegitimates 1899</td>
  <td class="tdr">66,855</td>

<tr>
  <td class="tdl">White illegitimates 1910</td>

</tr>

<tr>
  <td class="tdl">Colored illegitimates 1910</td>
  <td class="tdr">78,554</td>
</tr>

</table>

<p>Thus we see that there was an actual increase of
nearly 10,000 white illegitimate children from the
year 1899 to 1910, or an increase of 14.7 per cent; but
during the same time the white population had increased
24.7 per cent, so that there was an actual decrease
in the percentage, according to population, of
nearly 10 per cent. During the same period the colored
population had increased 5.9 per cent, but the
number of colored illegitimate children had decreased
3.9 per cent, there being actually a less number of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
colored illegitimate children in 1910 than in 1899,
although the population had increased. It seems very
probable that this is due to the fact that the great
majority of the colored population in Porto Rico is
to be found in the towns, where the school system is
more efficient than in the country districts and where
customs change more easily, due to wider associations
and to more frequent and continued intercourse with
people of other points of view.</p>

<p>In the country the custom has remained, with little
change, due to the fact that the isolation of the country
people and the comparatively small number of children
in the rural schools has given little opportunity
to work against the existing situation. Of the children
from the ages of one to ten years there was only
an increase of 1,397 white illegitimate children between
1899 and 1910, which was not anywhere near the rate
of increase of the white population as a whole. During
the same period there was an actual decrease in the
number of colored illegitimate children between the
ages of one and ten years, amounting to 7,717, or a
total decrease of illegitimate children under 10 years
of age of 6,320, which would lead us to believe that
within the last ten years the births of consensual
marriage and the number of illegitimate children have
decreased much more rapidly than the total census
figures would indicate.</p>

<p>In addition to the question of consensual marriages,
we find that under the Spanish administration, when
ecclesiastical marriage was the only form recognized,
there were no divorces registered in the Island of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
Porto Rico. With the introduction of the civil marriage
after the American occupation, and the institution
of divorce laws and the recognition of divorce
by the civil authorities, the question of divorce began
to demand attention, and in 1910 we find a total of
1,246 divorces among the people in the Island of
Porto Rico. About two thirds of these were women,<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
and the divorce question will undoubtedly in time
bring as many problems in Porto Rico as it has in
the United States.</p>

<p>According to the last report of the Insular Chief
of Police, it is estimated that there are in the Island
of Porto Rico at the present time about 10,000 homeless
children under 12 years of age who live by whatever
means they are able, many of them begging or
stealing, and most of them having no permanent
lodging place, sleeping at night in boxes or on doorsteps,
or wherever they happen to find a lodging place
secure from the rain. These children are, for the most
part, deserted and abandoned children of illegitimate
parentage, or orphan children whose parents have left
no provision for their care and education, and they
constitute a fertile soil for the implanting of criminal
tendencies and are ready material for older people of
criminal habits. They constitute a danger to the
security of the community, and if it were not for the
relatively high death rate that is found among people
of this class, the Island would soon be overrun by
citizens brought up under these criminal-forming conditions.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
The Insular Government should take measures
to reduce this danger by means of the compulsory
industrial education of this class of boys and girls.
There is enough Government land available to colonize
them in different parts of the Island under the care of
people trained in reformatory and industrial methods,
and this should be done in order that they may become
self-supporting individuals who will contribute
to the comfort of the community, rather than parasites
who live on the charity of others. There are any
number of small industries in which they might be
trained, as well as along agricultural lines, and the
trades which lack skilled workmen in Porto Rico
would be much benefited by adding to their number
graduates of industrial trade schools, taken from children
of this class; these schools should be operated by
the Government, at Government expense, but could
be made largely self-supporting by means of the sale
of the services of the boys, or through the sale of the
products turned out.</p>

<p>The living accommodations of the average rural
family are very unsatisfactory, consisting, as they do,
of a dwelling house of one room, or at the most, two.
This reduced house space makes it necessary to eat
and live and sleep in the same room, rendering impossible
any degree of privacy on the part of any of the
family. This condition in the case of growing boys
and girls is very undesirable, particularly since it is a
custom to take in as members of the family relatives,
sometimes of a rather remote degree of relationship,
in case they are left unprotected. Another feature of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
family life which tends toward degeneration and which
is found to a great extent in Porto Rico, is the intermarriage
between relatives within comparatively close
degrees of consanguinity. The civil laws of Porto Rico
prohibit the marriage of persons of closer degrees of
relationship than first cousins, and the ecclesiastical
laws of the Roman Church prohibit marriage within
eight degrees of consanguinity. In the record of one
family which produced 25 cases of insanity in two
generations, it was found that there had been a considerable
amount of intermarriage between relatives,
one of the grandparents marrying a person who was
prohibited by the ecclesiastical law on four different
grounds on account of consanguinity. Ecclesiastical
permission had been obtained to overcome these
difficulties and the marriage took place. There is no
doubt that close intermarriage and the failure to introduce
new stock into the family tends to both mental
and physical degeneration. And where families intermarry
for generations, as we find to be the custom in
a great many instances in Porto Rico, there can be no
doubt of the ultimate disastrous outcome from this
custom.</p>

<p>The average Porto Rican family lives very happily
and contentedly, the parents displaying great affection
for the children and for relatives even of a remote
degree of relationship. In the case of the death of
parents, relatives usually adopt or take charge of the
children which may be left and bring them up as carefully
as they would children of their own. The family
group is naturally closer among Latin peoples than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
among Anglo-Saxon races, and this has tended to do
away with some of the vices of family life which are
found among Anglo-Saxon peoples, while the same
circumstances have tended to increase other unsatisfactory
conditions of family life peculiar to Latin races.</p>

<p>One of the features which, from the standpoint of
society, may have an unfortunate result is the mixture
of races in the family life. While this has not taken
place to such an extent in the country districts as it
has in the towns, nevertheless, a great many families
in Porto Rico are composed of mixed races. The
biological tendency in cases of mixed races, according
to most authorities, is a decrease in the number of
children in the family as generation succeeds generation,
unless there is an addition of new blood to a
considerable extent. This may possibly be one of
the means which Nature has provided for solving the
problem of overpopulation in Porto Rico, but there is
the added fact that usually as the succeeding generations
become fewer in regard to numbers, they also
become less capable mentally and physically. The
race question in Porto Rico will undoubtedly come
to be one of the problems that has to be solved, and
it will be more difficult of solution than the race problem
in the United States, where the races are becoming
more widely separated every year and where it is very
infrequent to find persons of the two races in the same
family. In Porto Rico the problem will be intensified
because it is not merely a problem between races, but
a race problem which involves the family organization
in many cases. The government of Brazil has pre<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>dicted
that in a hundred years there will be no black
inhabitants in the Brazilian republic, that they will
be entirely assimilated by the white race or carried
off by disease. The census report for Porto Rico shows
a falling off in the black race of about 9,000 in the last
ten years, and an increase of about 30,000 in the mixed
or mulatto population. Thus the assimilation of the
black population is gradually taking place, and whether
this will in time lead to a complete assimilation, or
whether the mixed race will become weakened through
this racial intermarriage to such an extent that it
will eventually refuse to propagate, is a question
which only time can answer. There is no doubt, however,
that this is one of the problems that must be
confronted in Porto Rico.</p>


<h2 id="RURAL_HOUSING_CONDITIONS">RURAL HOUSING CONDITIONS</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> housing of a people is always a matter of prime
importance in their social life and development. There
is little progress until the housing conditions are comfortable
and hygienic, and the development of the
home and the family life depends to a great extent
on the conditions under which a people lives. The
housing conditions in Porto Rico, especially for the
poorer classes, are far from satisfactory. The dwellings
of the country people are described as follows,
in the Report on the Housing Conditions in Porto
Rico, published by the Insular Bureau of Labor in
1914:</p>

<p>"There are five general problems which the laborer
or employer in tropical countries, who is anxious to
build cheap but proper houses, has to meet. The
first is to provide adequate protection against the
heat. As in northern countries it is necessary to
shut out the cold winds and generate and conserve
artificial heat within the house, so in tropical countries
it is equally important to let in the breezes and to
clear out any artificial heat that may arise.</p>

<p>"The second problem is to provide protection against
the frequent tropical rains. This is especially important
in tropical countries that have a protracted rainy
season, as it is often difficult to shut out the rain without
also shutting out the fresh air.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p>"The third problem is the provision of adequate
sanitary facilities. Due to the heat in southern
countries and to the humidity that prevails during
certain seasons of the year, this problem is more difficult
of solution and likewise more important than in
countries farther north.</p>

<p>"The fourth problem is that of securing cheap and
durable building materials. In a land like Porto Rico
where tropical shrubs and the palm are practically
the only woods that the laborers are able to obtain,
we must not expect the same solid, commodious habitations
which are found in northern countries where
the pine and hemlock abound.</p>

<p>"The fifth problem, perhaps as important as any
of the preceding and certainly as difficult to remedy,
arises partly from the generosity of nature herself.
People can live in tropical countries in almost any
form of habitation. Cold winters have not obliged
the poorer classes to be adepts in house construction.
Poverty has forced them to live as cheaply as possible.
Naturally, the laboring classes engaged in tilling the
soil still make their homes in the cheapest forms of
huts. This problem has, therefore, three aspects&mdash;an
over-indulgent climate, poverty, and a lack of
opportunity by the poorer classes to learn better
methods of house construction.</p>

<p>"In Porto Rico we have, in addition to the problems
mentioned above, two special conditions which
have influenced the form and quality of our laborers'
houses. The first is that the seasonal character of
many of our agricultural industries forces the laborers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
to migrate from one section to another in order to
find work and, naturally, they are not inclined to
go to the expense and exertion of building substantial
homes. The second, and more important, arises from
the fact that the greater part of our laborers do not
own the land their houses are placed upon and, being
subject to ejection at the will of their landlords, they
have no incentive to beautify or improve their homes.</p>

<p>"According to the census of 1910, the urban territory
of Porto Rico&mdash;that is, the places of 2,500 inhabitants
or more&mdash;contained 224,620 inhabitants,
or 20.1 per cent of the total population, while 893,392
inhabitants, or 79.9 per cent, lived in places of less
than 2,500 inhabitants, and of these, 837,725 lived in
strictly rural territory. Needless to state, the greater
part of the rural inhabitants belong to the laboring
classes and live in the types of rural homes described
in this section.</p>

<p>"We have divided the habitations of rural laborers,
according to their construction, into the following types:
(1) Single houses of thatch, (2) single houses of wood
and zinc, (3) tenements of wood and zinc.</p>

<p>"Most of the thatched huts in the rural sections
have been built by the laborers who live in them.
The land upon which these houses are built is, however,
usually the property of some plantation or landowner.
Only in the more inaccessible sections inland do the
laborers who have built these thatched houses also own
the land they are placed upon. It is the custom among
the landowners to allow laborers who work for them
to take the necessary materials&mdash;grass, sticks, palm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>-bark,
etc.&mdash;from the land and build their huts.
This is done, of course, with the consent of the landowner,
and the huts so built are legally attached to the
land and become the property of the landowner. As
a matter of fact, the laborers who have built these huts
claim them as their property and are allowed to live
in them without charge or molestation so long as they
work for the landowner when their services are needed.
When a laborer who has built a hut leaves it and moves
to another's land, the hut is claimed by the landowner
and some other laborer is allowed to move into it.
There are also some of these huts that have been
built by the landowners at their own expense, but the
plantation owners and other landowners who have
gone into the business of building houses for their
workmen usually construct a better type of house. The
thatched hut, therefore, while it is legally a plantation
house, is not usually so considered, either by the landowner
or the laborer.</p>

<p>"If we judge the importance of a type of house
from the number of people who live in it, this thatched
hut is far more important than any other rural or
urban type. The great mass of the rural laborers live
in houses of this type and, as has been shown, fully
three-fourths of the total laborers of the Island live in
rural sections.</p>

<p>"The homes of the wealthy in all parts of the world
are constructed to conform to the standards of the
age and place in which they are erected, and to the
personal desires of the occupants, regard being taken
only of the absolutely necessary conditions of environ<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>ment.
The houses of the poor, on the other hand, are
the direct product of local environment. The hut
of the inland laborer of Porto Rico, the <i>jÃ­baro</i>, is a
striking illustration of the effect of environment upon
the type of house in which the poor live.</p>

<p>"The problem of obtaining cheap and durable building
materials is a very difficult one for the poor laborers
of Porto Rico. Hard woods are extremely scarce, and
the poor inland laborer cannot afford to buy imported
lumber, and, therefore, he has been obliged to utilize
the coarse grasses and the products of the palm trees
that are accessible at little or no expense except the
labor necessary in their preparation. Furthermore,
many of these people have not the skill nor the necessary
tools to use materials such as stone and clay which
they might be able to obtain. Also, the migratory
character of many of these inland laborers, and the
fact that they do not own the land their houses are
built upon, have been fundamental influences in preventing
the development of better house types. The
principal agricultural industries, <i>i.e.</i>, coffee, sugar, and
tobacco, have a busy and a dull season, and many of
the inland laborers are obliged to migrate from one section
to another in order to find work. For this reason
hundreds of laborers pass annually from the inland
hills where coffee is grown down to the sugar plantations
on the coast, and then back again to the hills,
the busy seasons of sugar and coffee being at different
times of the year. Of course, these laborers cannot
move their houses with them about the Island, and they
naturally tend to build the cheapest kind of temporary
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
structures. Also very few of them own the land their
houses are placed upon. They are mere squatters,
or tenants at will, and the land owner may eject them
at any time for little or no cause, so that there is no
incentive to build substantial structures, and there is
no chance of developing that pride in the home which
is so essential to the building of good houses.</p>

<p>"The inland laborers who live in these huts have
been their own architects and builders, and they model
their homes after the old type that has prevailed
among the hills for centuries. The framework of these
huts is of poles and small sticks cut from shrub trees
and nailed or tied together at the corners with native
fiber ropes. The roofs are generally thatched with a
long, tough grass, and the walls are constructed by
binding leaves of the royal palm (<i>yaguas</i>) with sticks
and fiber. The floor is of boards or slabs and is raised
from one to two feet above the ground. In some sections
<i>yaguas</i> are also used for the roofs, and in the
inland there are many huts with walls of slabs from
the trunk of the palm trees. These huts are usually
divided into two rooms by a flimsy partition of <i>yaguas</i>,
one room being used as a bedroom and the other as a
combined living and dining room. The kitchen is a
separate room or shed at the rear, and, probably because
of the danger of fire, is usually without floor.
The furniture consists of hammocks, boxes for chairs,
a rough table, and a few dishes, all made from gourds,
except the iron pot used in cooking. The value of
such furniture is usually from $4 to $6, and the value
of such a house from $10 to $20.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p>"This hut of the inland laborer with its thatched
roof and open construction is, in many respects, a
much better house than the casual observer is likely
to believe. A well-constructed thatch roof, when it
is new, offers sufficient protection against rain and
excellent protection from the heat of the tropic sun.
New palm bark walls are also adequate to keep out the
rains. Furthermore, almost without exception, the
floors are raised above the ground, so that the surface
waters after a shower run freely under the hut and
wash away any refuse that may have accumulated,
and then the sunlight and winds quickly dry the remaining
dampness. In other words, a new well-built
hut of this type is a properly ventilated, cool, and
reasonably sanitary habitation, and represents the
best effort of the laborers to adapt themselves, in their
poverty-stricken condition, to the circumstances of
their environment. On the other hand, these huts
deteriorate very rapidly. Within six months or a
year, a dozen varieties of insects have made their
nests in the thatched roof, the palm-leaves have
cracked, and the floor sags.</p>

<p>"One who stands on some projecting point high up
on a mountain side in the interior of the Island and
carefully scans the hillsides about and the valley beneath,
will be amazed at the number of small huts of
this type that lie within his view. There are hundreds
of them. Every knoll is crowned by its hut; every
hillside is dotted by them. No two are ever placed
together; each family seeks its own free life. It is
practically true that one cannot shout in any part of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
our Island and not be heard by the occupants of one
or more of these huts.</p>

<p>"To say that these people are contented and prefer
to live as they do, is not true. Customs clinch themselves
upon a people so that they appear contented, and
these inland laborers have lived under the same conditions
for three centuries. Their standards of living
are modest, and their desires are few. In this sense they
are contented. Yet there is a deep and powerful
change coming over them. They are going to the
cities in greater number than ever before; their children
are attending the little schools in the hills. New
ambitions are awakening. When the dull season comes,
they cannot find work. There are times when many
of them are hungry. They are not contented.</p>

<p>"That the Porto Rican laborer is of cheerful disposition
is especially true of the so-called <i>jÃ­baro</i>. He
has been obliged to find his joy in simple things. He
greets you with a smile; he welcomes you to his house
and cheerfully divides his cup of coffee with you; he
dances with a show of gayety on a Sunday afternoon.
He is ever cheerful, but not happy. There may be
some customs and prejudices of minor importance that
he is loath to change, but in the main he prefers to
live as he does because he is obliged so to live. Those
who adhere to the <i>laissez faire</i> policy and believe that
conditions are good enough as they are, do not know
the real heart of these people. They need and deserve
and must ultimately receive the opportunity
to improve their living and working conditions.</p>

<p>"There are two important causes for the erection<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
of plantation houses: (1) For the employer, the practical
advantage of having a resident supply of labor
on his land; (2) for the laborer, the necessity of living
near his work. Laborers who live in plantation houses
are more largely dependent upon the plantation than
are laborers who live in their own homes. One of the
conditions of occupying a plantation house is that the
occupants will work for the plantation whenever their
services are required. Laborers living in plantation
houses, can, therefore, be depended upon by their
employers, and this is a great advantage to the plantation
owner. Furthermore, such houses are usually
much better than the laborers who live in them could
afford to build for themselves. Frequently, also, the
holdings of the plantation are so extensive that it
would not be possible for the laborers, even if they
had the money, to buy land upon which to build
their houses within walking distance of their work.</p>

<p>"There are great differences between the single
houses of wood and zinc erected by the various plantations.
The better types have been built by employers
who wished to provide healthful and comfortable
quarters&mdash;increase the efficiency of their laborers as
well as to hold their labor supply. Unfortunately,
at present, such houses are not being erected by the
plantations in all parts of the Island. The majority
of these houses have been built with the sole purpose
of holding as large a labor supply as possible at the
least expense.</p>

<p>"The houses of this type are usually roofed with
large strips of zinc, nailed directly upon the rafters.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
These roofs are low, unceiled and, as a result, the
houses are extremely hot. The walls are of imported
lumber, sometimes the boards being matched and in
other cases clapboarded. The better houses are
painted to diminish the depreciation and to awaken
the pride of the occupants in their homes. The walls
are six or seven feet high. The floors are of boards
and raised from one to two feet above the ground.
The houses are set upon posts so that there is a
clear space under them that can be easily cleaned.
On the interior they are divided by half partitions into
two or three rooms and are usually provided with
separate kitchens, frequently one kitchen serving for
from one to four houses. These houses cost from $70
to $150, the average being about $80, according to
their size and construction. This description refers
to the better houses of this type and, unfortunately,
the majority of the single plantation houses are not
so well constructed.</p>

<p>"These tenements represent the older type of plantation
houses and fortunately very few of them are
being built at the present time. Their construction has
been prompted by the same reason that has induced
employers to build the single type of plantation house&mdash;the
desire to hold a resident supply of labor on the
plantation. They are, however, far inferior to the
single houses.</p>

<p>"The better rural tenements are built with zinc
roofs, board walls and floors, and are raised from one to
two feet above the ground. They are unceiled and
have no windows. In the inland many of them have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
zinc walls. The poorer ones are located on low,
swampy land and are built of oil cans, pieces of boxes,
and other odds and ends. Some of them have separate
kitchens and sanitary facilities, but many have nothing
except such temporary and inadequate structures as
the occupants have themselves built. The first reason
for building tenements of this type has been, of course,
to house the greatest number of laborers at the least
expense. They are long structures, one or two rooms
wide, each room an apartment, and crowded with
people. Although these rural tenements are not
usually being built at present, there are still hundreds
of them in use.</p>

<p>"The worst housing conditions upon the plantations
prevail in the buildings, usually tenements of this type,
set aside as sleeping quarters for unmarried laborers.
This type of labor is transient, coming for a few months
during the busy season and then passing on to another
section of the Island. Consequently, they are crowded
into whatever quarters may be available at the time.
The leaky rooms of the old sugar mills, the worst rooms
in the tenements, single houses that have been unused
for six months and are out of repair and filthy, are
usually used for the emergency&mdash;an emergency that
lasts from three to six months. Six, eight, or ten
hammocks are hung up between bare walls in a room
10 feet by 15 feet and are all filled each night. Conditions
of ventilation and general sanitation are
frightful.</p>

<p>"There is one notable exception. One of the largest
centrals of our Island has constructed a large,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
well-ventilated, and comfortable men's apartment. The
floor is of matched boards, solid and clean. The walls
are also of matched boards, but there is an open space
two feet wide at the top of the walls extending around
the building. Overhanging eaves prevent the rain
from beating in through this opening. The roof is of
heavy paper nailed to a thick wooden ceiling. Frames
are arranged in the interior of the building for hanging
hammocks, and around the walls are large individual
lockers for the use of those sleeping there. Finally,
the building is cleaned thoroughly every day.</p>

<p>"No description of the housing conditions of rural
laborers would be complete without mention of the
gardens cultivated by the occupants of the houses.
It is safe to say that nine out of every ten laborers in
the rural sections, with the exception of those who live
in plantation houses where there is no land that they
are permitted to cultivate, have planted some sort of
garden. It is also true that these gardens are, in most
cases, of very little practical use. Well cultivated
and productive gardens belonging to rural laborers are
hard to find.</p>

<p>"The average garden consists of two or three plantain
or banana trees, a few tubers, and some medicinal
plants. Frequently, there are many and beautiful
flowers. Whatever vegetables there may be are poorly
cared for and do not produce more than a third of a
proper yield.</p>

<p>"This subject is of tremendous importance. The
soil and climate of Porto Rico are such that it should
be able, even with its dense population, to produce<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
most of its food. There are unused plots of ground
around practically every hut in the interior of the
Island. The decrease in the production of sugar is
going to throw many laborers out of work and they
will be obliged to raise most of their own food or suffer.
Many reasons have been advanced to explain the
absence of good small gardens. The laborers themselves
say that they do not plant and cultivate gardens
because they do not own the land and they are allowed
to plant only on condition that they give the greater
part of their produce to the landowners. They claim
also that it does not pay to break up the ground for
one crop and that after they have got plantains, etc.,
growing they may be obliged to move. It is also true
that in most cases they have not money enough to
buy the seed or hire the oxen and implements needed for
breaking up the ground.</p>

<p>"Also, in some parts of the south coast, it is too dry
for profitable gardening. On the other hand, landowners
frequently say that the reasons why laborers
in the rural sections do not plant gardens are lack of
knowledge of gardening methods, lack of realization
of the benefits that they could derive from good gardens,
and custom. Without discussing the relative
merits of these reasons, there are two things that must
be faced&mdash;such laborers must be educated, so far as
possible by example, and they must be offered the
opportunity to hold land with some fixity of tenure,
either by purchasing it on the installment plan or by
obtaining leases from the present landowners."</p>


<h2 id="WOMAN_AND_CHILD_LABOR">WOMAN AND CHILD LABOR</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Fortunately</span>, the factory system has not been
introduced to any great extent into Porto Rico, nor
in all probability will woman and child labor in factory
employment ever constitute a serious problem. The
census of 1910 gives only a total of 1912 woman wage
earners in various industries of the Island. This, of
course, does not include the woman who works throughout
the rural districts, and whose condition constitutes
the problem which must be studied and remedied in
the Island.</p>

<p>The average unskilled laborer in the country districts
of Porto Rico does not earn a sufficient sum to
enable him to maintain his family in comfort. As a
result, the wife, and frequently the children, must
contribute to the support of the family as much as they
can. In some parts of the Island, the tasks of the
country women are largely limited to their housework
and the cultivation of whatever garden products they
may raise, because such crops as sugar cane do not
call to any great extent for the use of woman labor.
In other sections of the Island, however, particularly
those parts where coffee growing is the chief industry,
the gathering and caring for the coffee crop is left, to
a great extent, to the women and children. This,
of course, results in a financial saving to the coffee
grower, as the wages for woman and child labor are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
much less than for the services of men. The unhealthful
results, however, more than offset the advantages
gained by adding the mother's wages to the
family income.</p>

<p>The harmful results from woman labor may be
classified as direct and indirect. Under the directly
harmful results are the weakened physical condition
of the mother, the increased susceptibility to diseases
which are especially common in the coffee districts,
particularly anemia, and such diseases as are the results
of exposure. The larva of the hookworm lives and
finds a fertile field for action in the damp and shady
regions devoted to the production of coffee, and as the
majority of the women laborers are not accustomed
to wear shoes, they easily permit contact and contagion
from this disease.</p>

<p>The strength of children and their ability to withstand
disease depends to a great extent upon whether
or not they are physically strong at the period of
their birth and during the time they are under the
direct care of the mother. A mother whose system
has been weakened by the debilitating effects of anemia,
cannot nourish her child and provide him with the
necessary amount of food, and as a result, the child
is either anemic, or a victim to malnutrition as a
result of introducing solid food into his system before
the digestive organs are prepared to take care of
such food.</p>

<p>Among the indirectly harmful results of woman labor
is the necessary separation of the mothers from the
children of the family. The mother on going to work,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
either leaves her children in the care of a neighbor, or
leaves them at home where the older children take
care of the younger. This deprives the children of
the mother's influence and allows them liberty to
associate with children who may be undesirable companions,
which would be avoided to a great extent if
the mother were present to take care of them. The
Juvenile Court records in the United States show that
85 per cent of the delinquent children brought before
the court have been led into bad habits through the
failure of one or both of the parents to take care of
their supervision during play hours. Divorce in the
United States has been strongly attacked for the
reason that it deprives the child of one of his legal
protectors. From the same point of view, woman
and child labor, which deprives the child of the care
of his mother, must inevitably produce bad results in
the growing generation.</p>

<p>The use of child labor in Porto Rico is not particularly
preferred except in coffee districts and in certain
agricultural sections where boys are used at certain
times of the year to help drive the oxen, or to help in
planting the crop. As this is outdoor work it does not
have the devitalizing effect upon the child's body
which factory work would have, and as it does not
require concentrated attention, it is relieved from the
monotony which would tend to lower the child's mental
ability. The evil results which must be guarded
against are those arising from overwork and from
association with undesirable characters while the child
is not under the supervision of his parents. In addi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>tion
to this, the child who is engaged at work must
lose the benefits which he should be receiving from
attendance at school. During the last year, the
Department of Education has attempted to solve this
problem by changing the vacation period, so that the
long vacation of three months will fall at the coffee-picking
season in such sections of the Island as are
devoted to the production of this crop, and where
previously there was a great decrease in school attendance
at the time when the harvesting of the
coffee was in progress. This, undoubtedly, will
greatly help to do away with the harmful results
which formerly were the consequences of irregular
attendance or non-attendance at school on the part
of a great many of the children in the coffee-growing
districts.</p>

<p>An increase in the number of rural schools so that
all of the children of the rural districts can be accommodated,
is also necessary before this problem is entirely
solved. At the present time, a large number of
the children in the country cannot attend school,
either because the school in the neighborhood is overcrowded,
or because the nearest school is at too great
a distance for them to attend with regularity. The
removal of these conditions unfortunately depends
upon an added appropriation for the maintenance of
the Department of Education, and it is doubtful
whether the income of the Island will be sufficient to
supply the needed increase for years to come. With
the gradual improvement of roads, consolidated schools
may help to solve the problem, and a half-day enroll<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>ment
for each group will tend to increase the number
of children that can be taken care of. Children who
find that they cannot obtain a place in the school
will naturally be made use of by their parents for
wage-earning purposes whenever possible, but the
great majority of parents would not put their children
at work if the children were enrolled in school and if
irregularity of attendance were to lead to dismissal
from the school.</p>

<p>Another thing that would help to relieve the situation,
as far as woman and child labor is concerned,
would be the establishment of a minimum wage for
unskilled farm labor, such wage to be sufficient to
enable the laborer to maintain his family without the
help of money earned by the wife or children. The
time of the wife could be occupied in poultry raising
and in caring for the family garden, which would also
tend to reduce the cost of living for the family and
could easily be established, if the landowner were to
provide sufficient garden space with each house in
addition to the regular wages paid his laborers. Of
course, methods of gardening would have to be included
in the rural school programs, and the rural
teacher should act as a supervisor of these gardens and
advisor to the people of the community in which he
is employed.</p>

<p>The important things to guard against in the life
of the family, from the standpoint of the welfare of
both the family and the community, are that the
mother need not be obliged to dissipate the strength,
through outside labor, which she needs in the raising
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
and caring for her family. The lack of proper supervision
of the children through the absence of the mother
from the home must also be guarded against. In case
it can be proved that a father is unable through his
own efforts to earn sufficient to maintain his family,
a system of mothers' pensions carried on by the government
should be established in order that the mother
may be safeguarded from want in case of the death
of her husband, and that she may not be obliged to
help him in the maintenance of the family through
the performance of such labor as would interfere with
her regular family obligations.</p>


<h2 id="INDUSTRIES">INDUSTRIES</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> principal industries of Porto Rico are necessarily
of an agricultural character, and their importance to
the Island financially is shown by the fact that during
the year 1914-15 exports to the value of $49,356,907
left for the United States and foreign countries. The
imports for the same period reached the amount of
$33,884,296, thus giving a good surplus to the Island
after the total imports had been paid for. The principal
classes of imports are the foodstuffs which might
be produced in sufficient quantities to maintain the
population of Porto Rico. This is a situation which
should receive attention, inasmuch as the Island is
capable of producing all of the foodstuffs which it
needs for its own consumption. The principal article
of export from Porto Rico is sugar and other products
of the sugar cane. The article of export second in
value is tobacco in its various forms. Third comes
coffee; and these three products make up the chief
source of wealth.</p>

<p>The chief criticism in regard to the agricultural
situation of Porto Rico at the present time, is that
there has been very little development of small farm
products which would tend to make it possible and
profitable for the landholder who is in possession of
only a few acres to earn a comfortable living. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
climate and soil of Porto Rico would, undoubtedly,
lend themselves to the production of many fruits and
vegetables which could be raised with profit on farms
limited in size, and which would enable the small
farmer to maintain his family.</p>

<p>In addition to the introduction of agricultural products
fitted for small farm production, an opportunity
should be given and efforts encouraged for the establishment
and improvement of such lines of work as
can be carried on in the homes or by a small group
of people working independently. Among these kinds
of work are several, such as the hat-making and
basket-making industries, the production of handmade
lace and embroidery, and other forms of needlework,
which might be carried on by women working independently
during the time they have free from the
occupations of their household work. These handmade
articles of Porto Rico are much sought after by tourists,
and there is no doubt but that a large and profitable
market could be opened for them in the United States,
if efforts were made to establish the production on a
commercial basis. The individual living in a small
town who devotes himself to hat making is handicapped
because he has no steady market for his goods
and is obliged to sell them or trade them for whatever
he can obtain from retail dealers, who themselves
attempt to secure only the limited trade which enters
their stores. In order to make industries of this sort
profitable to the producers, it will be necessary to
secure a new and permanent market for the goods,
and either the government or some group of indi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>viduals
who will not exploit the workers, should act
as middlemen to see that the work is uniform in character,
and to attend to the handling of the finished
products and the supplying of a market for it in the
United States. Working as individuals, the countrymen
or dwellers in small towns have turned out products
which differ in quality and in design, and very
frequently the lack of resources has obliged them to
construct their products from unsuitable or cheap
materials.</p>

<p>They have been accustomed to ask for their products
as high a price as they thought they could obtain, and
often this price is too high for the quality of the article,
while sometimes it does not pay for the labor and time
which has been expended in the production of the
article. By systematizing the work and putting it
under the direction of competent supervisors who
would specify the quality of material to be used in
the production of the articles, and who would fix a
price which would fairly represent the time and labor
expended by the producer, and who would be able to
reject work that did not meet the standard set, the
value of the goods would be increased. An equally
necessary step in this matter would be the providing
of a regular market for the goods and the supervision
of production, so that the market would not be overloaded
with certain articles and lacking in others.
Experiments already carried out have proved the
existence of a market for Porto Rican goods in the
United States, and the matter should be taken up
under the supervision of the Insular Government.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
In order to produce trained workers for the production
of these articles, it would be necessary to establish
schools for their instruction which might well be under
the direction of the Department of Education. These
schools would not necessarily last throughout the
year, nor would they require any great expenditure of
money for their maintenance. The character of the
school should depend upon the locality in which it was
established and should be designed only for the training
of skilled workmen, either child or adult, in particular
lines of work. Short courses of two or three
months in these industrial schools should be offered,
and the people who attend them should be assured
of a market for their goods when they have arrived
at a point where they can produce goods of the proper
standard. The money expended in the establishment
and maintenance of these schools would more
than double the earning capacity of the unskilled
worker, and the general welfare of the community would
be increased by the changing of unskilled and unproductive
citizens into trained, productive laborers.</p>

<p>It is a well established fact that the trained workman
is the most desirable kind of citizen. The unskilled
laborer has no steady market for his labor and is the
first victim in the wage system whenever a financial
crisis causes the employer to lessen his expenses. The
unskilled laborer has for sale a product which the
average employer is not anxious to obtain, whereas
the skilled worker can find a much more steady and
regular market for his labor. The lawless, irresponsible
class of citizens in any community is always<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
composed to a great extent of the unskilled laborers,
and any country which has an overwhelming proportion
of its population composed of this class of people
is in constant danger of labor disturbances and conflicts
between employers and employees. The great
majority of the men in penal institutions are unskilled
laborers, and if the proportion of this type of citizens
is sufficiently large, it may constitute a real danger to
the community. With increased ability to earn wages
comes the desire to improve living conditions and to
rise higher in the social scale. This demands added
education, more hygienic surroundings, and better
food and clothing. The man who earns fifty cents a
day, and that at irregular periods, is an early victim
to dissatisfaction and is easily made to believe that
life has not much for him in the future, and that he
has not been fairly treated by his employer. The
skilled laborer who earns double this amount or more,
begins to take a new interest in life, as he can see the
results which have come from his directed efforts, and
values the benefit to his family; he educates his children,
sees to it that they are well clothed and fed, and
he himself becomes interested in the life and problems
of the community as he becomes gradually a person of
some importance in its economic and social life. A
dependent wage-earning population usually lacks ideals
of self-improvement, but the steady-working, independent
producer of marketable goods is constantly
striving to improve the amount and quality of his
products.</p>


<h2 id="THE_LAND_PROBLEM_AND">THE LAND PROBLEM AND
UNEMPLOYMENT</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">One</span> of the most difficult problems to solve in the
case of a small country such as Porto Rico, and one
which has a definite bearing on both the economic and
the social life of the people, is the land situation.
This is especially true when the chief industries are
such as lend themselves more readily to large plantation
farming rather than to small industries or crops
which can be raised profitably on small areas. The
most important products of Porto Rico to-day are
large-farm products, and they naturally tend to develop
a small number of large landowners and a large
number of landless citizens. There were in 1910,
46,799 farms operated by their owners, and it was
estimated that 600,000 people or 117,647 families in
rural sections belonged to the landless class. An
equally large proportion of landless citizens is found
in urban centers. Of the 10,936 people in Puerta de
Tierra in 1913, only 178 or about 30 families owned the
land on which their houses were located. It is estimated
that there are at least 800,000 people or 156,860
landless families in Porto Rico.</p>

<p>In addition to the tendency toward lawlessness that
is always found where there is an overproportion of
landless citizens, the systems of land rental in Porto
Rico have certain unfortunate economic aspects which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
call for consideration. Part of the renters live in
houses which are owned by the proprietor of the land
upon which their houses are located, and here the case
resolves itself simply into the ordinary relations of
renters and householders. This system does not
differ to any great extent from the ordinary rent system
in the States and has the same disadvantages, both
economical and social, which are to be found wherever
the rental system is in operation.</p>

<p>A second system which has been known as the "Land
Rent System" is somewhat different. Under this system
a man rents a lot from the owner of the property
and proceeds to erect his own house upon the land.
He then owns the house but not the land upon which
it is located. Usually he rents from the proprietor
from month to month or from year to year and has
no definite lease of the land, and there is nothing to
prevent the owner from raising the rental price or
from demanding the house of the renter whenever he
feels so inclined. As a matter of fact, it frequently
happens that the land is rented to householders at
fifty cents or a dollar monthly for the purpose of
building houses, and within a short time after the
completion of the house the owner of the land advances
the price of rent, so that the house owner
finds himself unable to meet the increased cost. He
then has no choice except to move out and leave
his house, together with the amount of work and invested
money which it represents, or to sell the house
to another person. Usually the house is sold to the
owner of the land himself, who thus comes into posses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>sion,
at a very reduced price, of a house which he, in
turn, rents to another individual. This system is
extremely unfortunate for the renter and should be
abolished by the passing of legislation which would
require the granting of a lease for a certain definite
period to every person who builds upon land owned
by another.</p>

<p>A modification of this system is frequently found
in the cases where employees build their houses upon
the land which belongs to the plantation. In many
cases the employer does his utmost to make the life
of his tenants as pleasant as possible, granting them
garden plots and trying to make them permanent
employees by offering them certain advantages. In
many cases, however, the employer maintains a company
store and requires his employees to purchase all
their provisions from the store, thus making a double
profit from them, and frequently charging them higher
prices than they would have to pay elsewhere. In
other cases the employer guarantees the credit of his
workmen at a given local store, and on pay day he
turns over to the local storekeeper the amount due the
workmen and the storekeeper deducts from this the
amount which is owing him for provisions and hands
over to the workmen what may be left. As the average
countryman has little idea of business and is lacking
in knowledge of how to keep accurate accounts, and,
moreover, since a credit system always tends to extravagance,
it frequently happens that the workman
is never entirely out of debt. There is a law approved
in 1908 which makes it unlawful "for any corporation,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
company, firm or person engaged in any trade or
business, whether directly or indirectly, to issue, sell,
give or deliver to any person employed by such corporation,
company, firm or person, payments of wages
to such laborers, or as an advance for labor not due,
in any script, token, draft, check or other evidence of
indebtedness payable or redeemable otherwise than
in lawful money." Section 2 of the same law provides
that "if any corporation, company, firm or person shall
coerce or compel or attempt to coerce or compel an
employee to purchase goods or supplies in payment
of wages due him from any corporation, company, firm
or person, such said named corporation, company, firm
or person shall be guilty of a misdemeanor." In this
way attempts have been made to protect the laborer
from exploitation, but violations of the law are not
uncommon.</p>

<p>There is need for legislation to provide opportunity
for the man of small means to purchase sufficient land
to establish a home. In Porto Rico there are about
121,346 acres of government lands located in various
parts of the Island which might well be opened to
settlement at a nominal price. Legislation should also
be passed which would provide that private land which
is not used for produce for a given term of years might
be opened to settlement and sold to people who would
occupy it and use it for production. There are many
acres of private land in Porto Rico which are not used
at all and have not been used for years. The accumulation
of land by an individual or a corporation
for purposes of speculation or for purposes other than
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
cultivation and use for the production of crops should
be discouraged, because the limited amount of land
in the Island does not permit such accumulation except
at the expense of the poorer class of people.
There is at present a law preventing the accumulation
of more than 500 acres of land by any company or
corporation, but no penalty has been provided for
the violation of this law, and it is practically useless
as it stands at present.</p>

<p>In addition to providing means by which people
would be encouraged to own and manage small farms,
coÃ¶perative organizations for providing a market for
the products of these farms should be established.
Undoubtedly, the government should start such a
movement. The spirit of coÃ¶peration is not strong
in Porto Rico at the present time, and the small farm
holder finds himself at a disadvantage when he has to
compete with the larger producer and when he is
obliged to find a market for his goods. Some such
system as exists in Denmark, where the farmers of a
community have joined themselves into coÃ¶perative
associations for selling their products and the purchase
of necessary supplies, might very well be introduced
into Porto Rico. This would tend not only to improve
the economic situation by bringing better prices
and a steady market for the farm products, and by
making possible the purchase of necessary supplies in
larger quantities, but it would also help to encourage
a sense of unity and mutual confidence among the
people of a given community, which would be of immense
value in raising the standard of citizenship.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
Community pride and a definite desire for improvement
would necessarily follow such a movement.</p>

<p>Farming is one of the few occupations which is not
influenced by seasons, so far as unemployment is concerned.
Practically all of the trades have their busy
seasons and their idle seasons, and any movement
which would tend to make employment more permanent
by providing small farms for a larger number of
people, would be of immense benefit to the Island as
a whole. The Bureau of Labor of Porto Rico in an
investigation which covered the last five months of
the year 1913, found that of the total number of union
men reported, 27 per cent were unemployed during
the month of August, 26 per cent during September,
38 per cent during October, 34 per cent during November,
and 46 per cent during December. The men
reporting were engaged in various occupations. It was
estimated that 28 per cent of all the laborers who reported
were unemployed on account of lack of work
and not on account of not desiring work. The different
trades represented are as follows: among the
dock laborers 62 per cent were unemployed, 56 per
cent of the carpenters, 47 per cent of the agricultural
laborers, 23 per cent of the cigar makers, and 10 per
cent of the typesetters reported that they could not
find employment. Thus it will be seen that when the
individual workman is at the mercy of the employer,
he has no independent status such as he would have
were he the owner of even a very modest piece of
property, and it is inevitable that he will find employment
only part of the year. Part time employment
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
tends to low standards of living, because during the
period of reduced financial income the standards of
living are lowered, and when it is found that the
family can exist on the reduced income there is little
inducement for seeking work since the desire for
economy and saving is not greatly developed among
the working classes of Porto Rico.</p>

<p>We find a gradual lowering of the moral standard as
the necessary accompaniment of low standards of
living, and if continued long enough, this low moral
standard gradually leads to moral and social degeneration.
The necessary steps should be taken by the
legislature to provide for the relief of the landless and
unemployed classes, as otherwise these people will
constitute a serious handicap for the economic and
social development of a competent body of citizens.</p>


<h2 id="POVERTY">POVERTY</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> meaning of the word poverty is relative and depends
upon the class of people to whom the word is
applied. Poverty, technically, is the lack of an income
sufficient to maintain the individual as the society in
which he lives demands that he should live. Thus a
wealthy man may live in relative poverty if he is in
a circle of acquaintances who are much more wealthy
than he is. The amount of income necessary to keep
one from being classed in the poverty-stricken group
decreases with the simplicity of individual, family, and
community life. The amount of property necessary
to keep one from poverty in the country is not as
great as the amount of property necessary to keep one
from poverty in the cities, due to the fact that the
standards of living in the country are much simpler
and require less expenditure of money to conform to
the social standards. Pauperism is not the same as
poverty. Poverty may be only temporary, depending
upon unfavorable conditions which have reduced the
income of the family, such as sickness, accident, lack
of employment, or other factors beyond the control of
the individual. Poverty does not necessarily involve
any moral degeneration, while the pauper is entirely
dependent on society and is a moral degenerate.
Poverty, in general, however, is a dangerous condition,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
because it generally leads to pauperism. Poverty perpetuates
itself if not taken care of; and if the poor
man should give up the struggle against poverty, the
general effect on society would be injurious, because,
through contact, standards of living, social disease,
and bad morals are contagious.</p>

<p>The competition between capital and labor, which
often leads to poverty, is not fair if it is limited to the
individual members of society. As the individual
capitalist has more influence than the individual
laborer, labor must be organized in order to equalize
the situation. The competitive process between capital
and labor, and between industrial organizations, should
be controlled so that people should not be compelled
to compete on an unfair basis.</p>

<p>The existing conditions in any community are largely
responsible for poverty and often for pauperism. They
are especially responsible for the attitude of the individual
in regard to poverty as to whether he will make
a fight to gain a place in society above the poverty-stricken
class, or whether he simply resigns himself to
his fate and continues to live in a poverty-stricken
condition. In this situation, the well-to-do class is
more responsible for poverty than any other class,
because they have the most power, both legislative and
moral, and they must assume for this reason a greater
share of responsibility regarding the conditions in any
given community. Poverty can be alleviated, but
probably not entirely eliminated, and some of the
means of combating poverty are the following:</p>

<p>First.&mdash;Education. By this means the efficiency<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
of the individual in adjusting himself to trade environment
is increased.</p>

<p>Second.&mdash;The self-support of weaker classes through
voluntary associations among themselves, such as labor
movements.</p>

<p>Third.&mdash;The proper kind of legal protection, such
as factory, and woman and child labor laws, safeguards
in factory work, the minimum wage, and accident laws.</p>

<p>Fourth.&mdash;Rational charity, by which cases of unusual
necessity can be cared for. This charity should
act as a temporary agency and should not become
permanent, as in that case it tends to pauperism.</p>

<p>Fifth.&mdash;Eugenics, by which the physically and
mentally unfit, who contribute largely to the pauper
class, may be eliminated from society and prevented
from propagating a second generation.</p>

<p>Modern charity is more democratic than older
charity, and in its workings material aid is made subordinate
to moral aid. It is optimistic and believes
that radical improvements in social conditions are
possible. It believes that the family should always
be a self-supporting group, that charity should try to
make the poverty-stricken family self-supporting, and
that the family should be kept together.</p>

<p>One of the improvements in modern charity is what
is known as organized charity, which is a sort of clearing
house for the charities of a community. Organized
charity does not extend material aid so much
as it attempts to find work for needy individuals and
thus do away with poverty by putting the family on
a self-supporting basis. Organized charity would do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
away with the begging pauper and require him to
present his case at the headquarters of the society,
where an investigation of the necessities of his particular
case could be made and an effort to find suitable
employment for him undertaken. The individual who
wished to contribute to charity would contribute to
the central organization instead of to the wandering
beggar. This would have two distinct benefits to
society, as it would prevent the disagreeable sights
often encountered where begging is allowed in public,
and it would prevent the individual member of society
from being imposed upon by a beggar who might
be in sufficiently good physical condition to undertake
work which would bring in enough to maintain himself
and his family.</p>

<p>The question of organized charity in Porto Rico
has been suggested at different times, but it has never
met with any great popular response, due to the customs
and traditions of a charity-giving people. The
Island to-day has a large number of paupers who are
entirely dependent upon the charity which they receive
through begging, and the custom of giving in
response to the requests of these beggars is so widespread,
that at the present time organized charity
would have a most difficult field of work to undertake.</p>

<p>The Island of Porto Rico is prosperous. In the last
fiscal year there was a surplus of about $15,000,000 of
exports over the imports into the Island; but the distribution
of wealth in Porto Rico is not equalized. It
has been estimated that the wealth of the Island is in
the hands of about 15 per cent of the population,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
and that the remaining 85 per cent are practically dependent
upon uncertain labor and wage conditions for
their maintenance. The per capita wealth of a country
determines to a great degree the financial situation as
far as the average individual is concerned. From the
following list of per capita wealth in some of the leading
countries, it will be possible to estimate how the
average Porto Rican compares with the average citizen
of other countries in this regard. The following
list is based on statistics of 1909:</p>

<p>From the above table it will be seen that the average
individual in Porto Rico is comparatively poor.</p>

<p>The economic situation in Porto Rico is giving rise
to the formation of classes based on wealth. With
the introduction of available markets and modern
methods of commerce and industry which followed the
American occupation, the land values rapidly increased.
The small landholder, seeing the increase in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
price which came about and believing that it was to
his best advantage to sell his land, disposed of it to
the representatives of large landholding concerns for
what, to him, was a fabulous price. As soon as the
money from this sale was expended, the original landholder
found himself absolutely dependent upon the
mercy of a wage-paying employer. In this way a
great part of small landholdings passed into the hands
of representatives of large landholdings and caused
the formation of the two groups, the capitalistic group,
which is limited to a comparatively small number of
people, and the wage-earning group, which comprises
probably 90 per cent of the population of Porto Rico.
As a result we lack in Porto Rico the great middle class
of financially independent farmers which constitutes
the strength of the United States and the more prosperous
European countries. A serious and systematic
effort to build up a prosperous and independent middle
class, either by encouraging small-farm or other industries,
is necessary if the majority of the people are
to attain the advantages which they should enjoy, and
if the social and economic status of the Island is to be
made equitable and stable.</p>

<p>The reduced wage system and the absolute dependence
of the wage-earning group has given rise to a great
many labor disturbances within the last few years.
These labor disturbances have included both city and
country groups and have in nearly all cases been caused
by an effort to better the working conditions and to
secure an increase of wages. In the great majority
of the cases there is no doubt but that the laborers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
were justified in asking for better conditions than those
which actually existed. That the disturbances sometimes
ended in riots and led to the destruction of
property is the fault of the educational condition of
the people, who are easily excited and led to believe
that only by the use of violence can they secure the
things which they demand.</p>

<p>The relation between poverty and health and poverty
and morals is very close. The poverty-stricken family
cannot be led to take any great amount of interest in
society or health betterment until means have been
produced by which the economic situation of the family
group can be bettered. The expense of living uses up
the daily wage of the ordinary unskilled laborer in
Porto Rico, who averages fifty or sixty cents per day
for the time that the weather and his physical condition
permit him to work. There is also a close relation
between sickness and poverty, the average countryman
of Porto Rico being only partly as efficient a
worker as he should be, due to physical weakness
caused by anemia or malaria. Poverty is closely related
to degeneration and crime, especially when it descends
into pauperism and absolute dependence upon
charity.</p>

<p>The climate and geographical conditions of Porto
Rico have never provided the laborer with any incentive
to economize, inasmuch as he has no need for
providing against a period of cold, and Nature produces
some form of plant or vegetable food throughout
the entire year. Clothing and lodging may be of the
simplest and still prevent much suffering under such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
conditions, and with physical weakness caused by
disease, the tendency is to live for the present, and to
take little care for the future through a system of
saving and economy. The average manual laborer
saves nothing and makes little effort to accumulate
property. Incentive must be provided through education
which will accustom the countryman to the
idea of accumulation of property in a small way, so
that dependence upon charity will not be necessary
in the case of a financial or economic crisis. That
there is a movement toward saving is evident from the
fact that on June 30, 1915, there were savings accounts
to the amount of $1,909,969.34 in the various banks
in the Island. This, however, is a comparatively small
amount, and the younger generation should be given
definite instruction and incentives along the line of
savings. The introduction of the Postal Savings Bank
has been of great value in this respect, and the school
savings banks have also done their share in inculcating
the principles of economy.</p>


<h2 id="SICKNESS_AND_DISEASE">SICKNESS AND DISEASE</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Island of Porto Rico is more free from disease
than the average tropical or semi-tropical country, due
to the active efforts of the medical profession and of
the special commissions and departments created for
the elimination of disease within the last few years.
Nevertheless, a great deal of sickness which might
be avoided, part of which is responsible for death, and
part of which merely incapacitates the sufferers or
renders them less useful citizens, is to be found. The
elimination of such diseases as smallpox and yellow
fever, which formerly were responsible for a great
number of deaths and which descended upon the
Island as epidemics with considerable regularity, has
been accomplished, and if similar care were taken in
the case of less dreaded diseases, there is reason to
believe that they could also be wiped out of existence
in the Island.</p>

<p>For the year 1915-16 there was a total of 26,572
deaths in Porto Rico. Most of these deaths were from
diseases classified as transmissible, and, consequently,
from diseases which could be prevented by complete
quarantine. Following is a list of the number of
deaths from the diseases which took the heaviest toll
in the Island:</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<p>The two diseases which are of most vital importance
to the people of Porto Rico at present are undoubtedly
tuberculosis and anemia. The ravages of tuberculosis
are more noticeable in the cities, and it has been stated
that in 1912, on one street in San Juan, 12 out of every
100 residents died of this disease. Anemia is prevalent
throughout the Island, but is more noticeable in the
country districts than in the cities, and while the
death rate for anemia is not so high as the death rate
of some other diseases, yet by reason of weakening
the vitality of the sufferers it tends to offer a fertile
spot for the incubation of germs of other diseases, and
the working and producing power of the individual
is lessened with the acuteness of the disease.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>It has been claimed that anemia was introduced
into Porto Rico by the negroes who were brought here
as slaves in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries,
and the identity of the disease with the anemia existing
in about 20 per cent of all the negroes of the Gold
Coast has been determined. The disease was for a
long time limited to the coast land and was propagated
on the sugar plantations, but after the introduction
of coffee, which has come to be the chief product of
the mountain regions, the disease was propagated
throughout the entire Island.</p>

<p>This disease has left its trace among the country
people and they have been accused of laziness and
idleness when it is probable that the cause of the
apparent disinclination for work is due to the weakened
physical condition which is a result of the anemia. In
this connection, Drs. Gutierrez and Ashford in their
work on <i>Uncinariasis in Porto Rico</i> quote Col. George
D. Flinter, an Englishman in the service of Spain,
who published in 1834 "An account of Porto Rico,"
as follows:</p>

<p>"The common white people, or lowest class (called
<i>jÃ­baros</i>), swing in their hammocks all day long, smoking
cigars and scraping their native guitars....
Most of these colonists are inconceivably lazy and indifferent.
Lying back in their hammocks, the entire
day is passed praying or smoking. Their children,
isolated from the cities, without education, live in
social equality with the young negroes of both sexes,
acquiring perverted customs, only to later become
cruel with their slaves."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>

<p>Commenting on this statement, Drs. Gutierrez and
Ashford speak as follows:</p>

<p>"What if these people were merely innocent victims
of a disease, modern only in name? What if the
brand placed by the Spaniard, the Englishman, and
the Frenchman in olden times upon the <i>jÃ­baro</i> of Porto
Rico were a bitter injustice? The early reports savor
strongly of those touristic impressions of the Island
which from time to time crop out in the press of modern
America, in which 'laziness and worthlessness' of the
'natives' are to be inferred, if, indeed, these very words
are not employed to describe a sick workingman, with
only half of the blood he should have in his body."</p>

<p>"True, Col. Flinter, Field Marshall Count O'Reilly,
and the rest of the long list of early 'observers' did not
know what uncinariasis was. But is it necessary that
we have a record of microscopic examinations of the
feces of the people they describe to realize what can
be read between the lines? Convicts, adventurers,
and gypsies may have formed part of the element that
colonized Porto Rico, but we cannot believe that these
were all, nor that their descendants were 'lazy' and
'worthless.'</p>

<p>"We cannot believe that vicious idleness comes
natural to the Spanish colonist, even in the Tropics,
for the very reason that we have seen these descendants
at their very worst, after the neglect of four centuries
by their mother country, and after the laborious increase
of an anemic population in the face of a deadly
disease, whose nature was neither known nor studied,
work from sunrise to sunset and seek medical atten<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>tion,
not because they felt sick, but because they could
no longer work.</p>

<p>"We strongly feel that these writers have unconsciously
described uncinariasis. Are the Spanish
people considered 'lazy' by those who know them?
Were those Spaniards who conquered Mexico, Peru,
and all South America, who formed so formidable a
power in the Middle Ages, a lazy people?</p>

<p>"Is it 'laziness' or disease that is this very day
attracting the attention of the United States to the
descendant of the pure-blooded English stock in the
Southern Appalachian Range, in the mountains of
Carolina and Tennessee, the section of our country
where the greatest predominance of 'pure American
blood' occurs, despised by the negro who calls him
'poor white trash'?"</p>

<p>During the year 1914-15 there were 6,644 deaths of
children under two years of age, which constituted
28.8 per cent of the total mortality of the Island.
Approximately 14 out of every 100 children born, died
in infancy, and the death rate for the total population
was 5.55 per cent for children under one year of age,
and 7.71 per cent for children under two years of age.
Diarrhea and enteritis were responsible for 33.8 per
cent of infant mortality; congenital debility for 13.14
per cent; infantile tetanus for 10.32; while disease of
the respiratory organs caused 16.17 per cent of the
infant mortality.</p>

<p>It has never been definitely determined just what
losses, from the point of view of days of labor, or from
the point of view of vitality of the laborer, have been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
caused by malaria. Mr. D. L. Van Dine, in an article
in the <i>Southern Medical Journal</i> for March, 1915, gives
the result of some of his investigations among the laboring
class in Louisiana. In this study, which was made
on one of the large plantations and which covered
74 tenant families with a total of 299 individuals,
he shows the losses which occurred from May to
October 15, 1914. There were 970 days of actual
illness of such a nature that the illness was reported
to the physician. Forty-eight out of the seventy-four
families were reported to the doctor for malaria.
According to Mr. Van Dine, this does not take into
consideration mild attacks of malaria which were not
reported to the physician, especially in the cases of
children. He has estimated that there were at least
487 days lost in cases which were not reported to the
doctor. He also estimates that there was a loss of
385 days on the part of the adults who assisted in caring
for the malaria patients. It is estimated that there
was a loss in days of labor equal to nearly six days and a
half for each case of malaria. It will easily be seen
that this may be a serious loss of time as far as the
production of crops is concerned, and even thus it
does not fairly represent the loss, as it does not take
into consideration the weakened energy of the man
just before or just after the malarial attack.</p>

<p>Undoubtedly, there is as great a loss in Porto Rico
from malaria as is indicated in the statements just
made. It has been reported that in some sections of
the Island, 85 per cent of the people were found to
have malaria germs in their blood. Between the two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
diseases of malaria and anemia, there is no doubt
that the physical condition of the Porto Rican countrymen
is gradually debilitated.</p>

<p>Since the American occupation, stress has been laid
upon the attempts to eliminate anemia, and this work
has received special attention since 1906. During the
year 1914-15 there were 32,278 new cases of anemia
treated in different parts of the Island, and 15,497
cases were discharged as cured.</p>

<p>Undoubtedly a great deal of the illness in Porto Rico
is the result of improper food, or food prepared in an
improper manner. Malnutrition among children is
frequent and leads to such diseases as rickets, which we
find has an exceptionally high death rate. In the
recent measurements given at the University among
university students, it has been found that there was
an average depth of chest of nearly half an inch more
than is found in the American boy or girl of the same
age, and this has been considered as an indication of
malnutrition and general softening of the bones in
early childhood.</p>

<p>A hemoglobin test which was given to the students of
the University this year showed that the average
among the men was 80.04 per cent, and only 77.6 per
cent among the women. The average for Porto Rico
should not fall below 85 per cent, and the anemic
conditions indicated by the low average is an indication
that the disease is to be found not only among the
country people, but also among people of the best
conditions of life.</p>

<p>It will be impossible to settle the economic and social
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
problems of Porto Rico until the question of personal
health has been more nearly solved than it is to-day.
With a large proportion of the country people sick
from anemia and malaria, and with tuberculosis as
prevalent as it is at the present time, the weakened
vitality will not permit strenuous or continued work
sufficient to improve economic conditions to any great
extent. Social conditions, depending as they do upon
the economic situation, must also be slow of improvement,
and the most important work facing the Government
of Porto Rico at present is the elimination of
such diseases as impair the physical condition of the
people and thus interfere with economic and social
progress.</p>


<h2 id="CRIME">CRIME</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Generally</span> speaking, criminals may be divided into
three classes: first, those who direct crime but who
take no active part in the commission of the crime
themselves; second, those who commit crimes which
require a considerable amount of personal courage;
third, those who commit crimes which do not necessarily
involve any great amount of personal courage.
There might be added a fourth class, which would
consist of those who commit crime through ignorance
of the law or carelessness in informing themselves of
exact legal measures and in heeding this knowledge
when once obtained. During the year 1915-16 there
was a total of 53,006 arrests in the Island of Porto Rico.
Of this number, nearly 47,000 were men and the rest
were women. On the basis of a population of 1,200,000,
this would give one arrest for every 22 persons in the
Island. Of this total number of arrests, however, only
438 were cases of felony. There were a great many
arrests for the infraction of municipal ordinances,&mdash;something
over 11,000 in all,&mdash;and more than 8,000
arrests for disturbance of the peace. Over 9,000 were
for gambling, and over 2,000 for petty larceny; about
5,000 arrests were for infraction of the sanitary laws,
and nearly 2,000 arrests were for infraction of road
laws. This shows that the greater number of arrests
was for comparatively unimportant crimes; by unim<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>portant
meaning, of course, those crimes which do not
directly involve the loss of life or of any great amount
of property. The felonies committed during the year
were as follows:</p>

<p>giving a total of 438, which includes not only those
sentenced but also those indicted and acquitted. From
this table it will be seen that a relatively small number
of the actual felonies committed are felonies involving
loss of life or an attempt against life. In support of
this table, and in proof of the fact that crimes of violence
are relatively few in Porto Rico, the following
table is given, which is a record of the convictions of

<p>From the above table it will be seen that crimes
against persons constitute 23 to 30 per cent of the
crimes committed. Of the total number of convicts
in the penitentiary for the commission of crime, 25
per cent, during the year 1914-15, were there for
crimes against persons. Thus we may definitely state
that about 25 per cent of the crimes carried to the
district courts of Porto Rico are those which involve
attempts against the life or well-being of another
person. It will be noticed from the above table that
with few exceptions the percentages of crimes for the
two years are very nearly equal. In 1913-14, 34 per
cent of the crimes were against property, which was
not strange when we consider that this was a year
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
of financial crisis, due to the sugar situation. In the
same year 23 per cent of the crimes were in violation
of laws enacted in exercise of police powers. These
crimes included breach of the peace.</p>

<p>In the following year, 1914-15, when we had about
17,000 laborers engaged in strikes throughout the
Island, and when in addition to this there was a general
Insular election, we find that the number of crimes
against property dropped to 17 per cent, whereas the
number of crimes in violation of laws enacted in exercise
of police powers rose from 23 per cent to 45 per
cent. This would tend to prove that the average lawbreaker
in Porto Rico is easily influenced by economic
circumstances and by social surroundings, and that at
such a period as that of strikes or elections criminal
tendencies take the direction of breach of the peace
and violation of municipal ordinances, rather than
such crimes as arson, burglary, embezzlement, or
forgery.</p>

<p>The influence of the election year is also noticeable
in the group of crimes prejudicial to the administration
of public justice, which includes contempt of court,
bribery, and perjury. During the year 1913-14, 3 per
cent of the convictions fell under this head, while
during the year 1914-15, the amount was 8 per cent.
It will be noticed that of the prisoners in the penitentiary
the percentage of those convicted for violation
of laws enacted in exercise of police power is only 10
per cent, much less than the percentage of those convicted
in the district courts. This, of course, is accounted
for by the fact that the great majority of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
violations of these laws are punishable by fines rather
than by imprisonment. In the same way, the percentage
of prisoners for crimes against property is
much larger than the percentage of convictions in the
district courts for this crime, due, of course, to the
fact that these crimes are more frequently punished by
a prison sentence than by a fine, thus giving an accumulation
from year to year of convicts, which overbalances
the per cent of the court convictions for any
single year.</p>

<p>According to the report of the Insular Chief of Police,
the town which had the greatest number of arrests,
in proportion to its population, for the year 1915-16,
was Arroyo, where there was one arrest for every 8.47
persons. This was followed by Salinas, with one
arrest for every 8.82 persons. The town with the
best record was Las MarÃ­as, where there was one
arrest for every 162.03 persons. On the basis of the
records of the municipal courts for the three years of
1912-13, 1913-14, and 1914-15, the judicial districts
stand in the following relation as far as the number of
criminal cases presented during that time is concerned.
The table given shows one criminal case presented every
three years for the number of inhabitants indicated in
each judicial district.</p>

<p>The great proportion of crime in San Juan, as compared
with the rest of the Island, is of course largely
due to social conditions, inasmuch as it is the largest
city in the Island and to a great extent the resort of
undesirable characters for this reason. In the second
place, as a coast town and the most important shipping
and commercial center, it has a more or less shifting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
population, and a population composed to a great extent
of an uneducated type among the working classes.
Every seaport town offers opportunities for criminal
classes which inland towns do not possess. The second
town in the list, Rio Piedras, is the natural outlet between
San Juan and the rest of the Island, which undoubtedly
accounts for its large percentage of crime.
The rest of the towns where crime is found in large
proportion will be discovered to have a large floating
population, people who are day laborers and who have
no particular interest in the community, except as it
provides them with an opportunity for earning daily
wages. This class of population is always unfavorable
to a community and is always to be found where large
industries exist which employ a great number of men;
and this is especially true when little attempt is made
on the part of the employer to render the permanence
of the job desirable by furnishing well-provided living
facilities for the employee. It is noticeable that in
Cabo Rojo, where the percentage of criminal cases
is lowest, the population depends chiefly upon the
hat-making industry for its support. This is added
proof of the value of small industries from the point
of view of community welfare.</p>

<p>It is noteworthy that there was an immense increase
in the number of crimes committed in the following
districts: Ciales, where the number of cases increased
from 431 in 1912 to 754 in 1915; Lares, where the increase
was from 352 to 853; Vieques, where the
increase was from 341 to 684; Yabucoa, where the increase
was from 589 to 831; Yauco, where the increase
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
was from 867 to 1,490. In the rest of the districts
the number of crimes did not vary greatly from year
to year, even decreasing in the case of Rio Piedras
from 1,101 in 1912 to 911 in 1915. Of course, the
difference in crime percentage might depend upon the
efficiency of the police force or upon the severity of
the Municipal Judge, but undoubtedly it will be
found more often to depend upon local conditions
such as strikes, or the introduction of large numbers
of workingmen from another district to take part in
agricultural or industrial work. The change of location
and the resulting necessity of accommodation to
local surroundings is apt to be dangerous to the morals
of the individual.</p>

<p>The great majority of the arrests were for crimes
which would be termed city crimes. The average
countryman of Porto Rico is a man who has a great
deal of respect for the law and is inclined to obey it
unless led into trouble in a moment of passion or
while under the influence of alcoholic drinks. Throughout
the country districts premeditated crime is rare,
and from the standpoint of improvement of the community,
the cities and large towns should be the chief
points of attack. A great deal of carelessness exists
as to complying with local laws and municipal ordinances,
and it is estimated that on June 30, 1915, there
were confined in the Insular jails and detention houses,
prisoners in the relation of one to every 7.17 inhabitants
of the Island. The chief work of the schools
along the line of prevention of crime should be the
explanation of laws, both Insular and municipal, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
the explanation of the reasons for such laws, in order
that the individual may be led by his own volition to
avoid lawbreaking. Parents should also be impressed
with the necessity of inculcating in their children a
respect for constituted authority and the necessary
obedience to it in order that as the children develop
into men and women they may have the proper respect
for the laws and those who have been appointed to
enforce them.</p>


<h2 id="INTEMPERANCE">INTEMPERANCE</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is unnecessary to say anything about the evil
effects of the use of alcoholic drinks, whether it be
from the physical, moral, or economic point of view.
The recent agitation in favor of the prohibition of the
manufacture and sale of alcoholic beverages in Porto
Rico, however, has caused more discussion regarding
the situation here than has ever before been the case,
and a brief statement of facts may not be unwarranted.</p>

<p>The Porto Ricans are not given to the overconsumption
of alcoholic drinks. They are not heavy drinkers,
and drunkenness is not at all common. Probably
every village has its unfortunate inhabitants, few in
number, who live usually under the influence of intoxicants.
But the great majority of the people are
not given to the excessive use of alcohol. The use
of wines is common, a custom characteristic of most
Latin peoples.</p>

<p>Porto Rico produces a great deal of alcohol, it being
one of the by-products of the sugar cane. Data are
not available to show just how much of the rum and
alcohol produced is used in the Island, and how much
is exported, or how much is used for drinking purposes
and how much for commercial uses. During the
fiscal year 1915-16, a total revenue of $1,111,834.30
was paid to the Insular government on alcoholic
liquors manufactured in Porto Rico or imported into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
the Island. This gives a per capita revenue of nearly
one dollar, and this revenue was paid on 3,886,705
liters of alcoholic liquors either manufactured here
or imported&mdash;a per capita allowance of more than
three liters for every inhabitant of the Island. It is
probably true that a great deal of the alcohol manufactured
in Porto Rico was exported, but even granting
that one half was not used here, the amount of
one and a half liters for every inhabitant is excessive.</p>

<p>The average grocery store carries a complete line
of bottled drinks, and often beer in the keg, as well.
This is one of the first things which impresses the
visitor from the States when he enters a grocery store
and sees the shelves packed with all kinds of bottles.
There is a constant sale for goods of this sort, usually
to the workingmen and poorer class of people, who
purchase in small quantities, a drink at a time, for
three or five cents; many of them, no doubt, attempting
to keep up their physical strength by the use of
such a stimulant, since a more noticeable stimulating
effect is produced by five cents' worth of
rum than could be obtained through the consumption
of five cents' worth of food. When this custom becomes
as prevalent as it is in Porto Rico, it involves
serious evil effects.</p>

<p>There are few drug users in the Island, and the strict
enforcement of the Harrison Drug Law will prevent
drug using from becoming the menace to health and
morals to the extent that we find to be the case in
many of the cities of the United States. There is,
however, a large quantity of patent medicines used,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
many of which have a sufficient amount of alcohol or
narcotic drug element to render them dangerous from
the point of view of habit formation.</p>

<p>Many of the poorer people do not have the money to
pay the fees of a doctor and to purchase at a drug
store the medicine which he prescribes. Moreover,
many medical men do not listen with as much patience
as they might, to the detailed list of complaints which
the countryman has to offer. As a consequence, the
countryman buys a bottle of medicine which has been
recommended to him by a friend, or perhaps by the
druggist, who often serves as a consulting physician
in the smaller towns. If the medicine makes him feel
better, he becomes a firm believer in its power to cure.
Whether the result produced is actually a bettering
of his physical condition, or merely a deadening of
the nerves by means of a narcotic, he does not stop
to ask. He recommends the medicine to his friends
as a sure remedy for all their illnesses, and probably
makes of it a household remedy, to be used by all
members of the family when they feel indisposed.
The author has known of many instances in which
medicine has been purchased from patent medicine
firms in the States, because of advertisements in the
newspapers, and of several cases, where the money was
returned by federal authorities with the statement that
the company addressed had been closed by the post
office authorities because it was found that their
claims were not legitimate and that their medicines
were valueless. The average Porto Rican places a
great deal of confidence in what he reads in the news
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>papers,
and the papers are not as careful as they should
be regarding the question of admitting advertising
matter.</p>

<p>There is no great amount of public opinion against
the use of alcohol in Porto Rico, and until, through
the schools, the press, or some other agency, the
people as a whole can be brought to see the disadvantage
of its use, there can be but little accomplished
in the direction of temperance and prohibition. The
prohibition movement in the United States is not a
matter of the moment alone, it is a movement which
has been growing for years, and at the present time
seems to have the majority of the population behind it.
This is not the case in Porto Rico, and it is doubtful
whether an abrupt change, unless backed up by strong
public opinion, and the authority of the great majority
of the people, would accomplish much in the way of
betterment of conditions.</p>


<h2 id="JUVENILE_DELINQUENTS">JUVENILE DELINQUENTS</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">One</span> of the most difficult problems that faces organized
society to-day is the disposal of delinquent
children, and in order to meet this problem, the
Juvenile Court system has been established in the
United States, and by a law approved March 11, 1915,
the Juvenile Court system was introduced into Porto
Rico to take effect on June 1, 1915.</p>

<p>Up to within recent times juvenile offenders have
been subjected to the same laws and the same penalties
as hardened criminals, and there is no doubt but that
a great many boys and girls who had broken some law
or local ordinance, often through carelessness or ignorance,
were placed in detention houses with older
criminals and in this way became accustomed to the
criminal classes and frequently were induced to enter
upon a life of crime.</p>

<p>The prevailing idea of criminal law is to punish the
offender for the offense committed against the laws of
the state. Modern social science teaches that it is
unfair to boys or girls of tender age to visit a punishment
of this sort upon them, especially when it may
lead to a continuance of crime, rather than to an avoidance
of it in the future. Consequently, with the introduction
of the Juvenile Court system the cases are
taken out of criminal procedure and placed under the
jurisdiction of courts of equity. The trials are usually
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
informal, although the child has a right to a trial by
jury in case he is accused of a serious offense, and he
has the right to legal counsel, if he so desires. These
rights, however, are very seldom exercised, inasmuch
as it is coming to be recognized that the judges represent
an actual attempt to do what is best for the child
and do not represent in any way the prosecuting power
of the state.</p>

<p>The principal figure in a Juvenile Court is the judge
of the court, and wherever it is possible to do so, men
especially trained in juvenile psychology should be
appointed to this office. A knowledge of children and
an understanding and appreciation of their feelings is
necessary on the part of the judge, and he should be a
person of sufficiently magnetic personality to win the
sympathies of the children and to enable him to gain
their confidence. To what an extent the influence of a
single man may reach in the case of juvenile offenders
and how far his influence may prevent crime among
children, is well seen in the case of Judge Lindsey, of
Denver, Colorado.</p>

<p>The second official in the court is the probation officer,
who is under the authority of the judge, makes the
necessary investigations when cases are reported to him,
and presents the facts in the case to the judge of the
court. He also must look after the children who have
passed through the court to see that the sentences of
the court are carried out; and if the children are placed
on probation under the guardianship of relatives or
friends, he must make visits sufficient in number and
often enough so that he can be sure that the best in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>terests
of the child are being safeguarded, and if he
finds the case to be otherwise, to report the facts to the
judge of the court.</p>

<p>As the financial situation in Porto Rico did not permit
the establishment of a completely new judicial
system, it was decided to appoint the judge of each
of the seven district courts of the Island to act as
judge of the Juvenile Court. The prosecutors and
municipal court judges are also probation officers
<i>ex officio</i>, and the justices of the peace and others
appointed by the district judges may be asked to
serve as special probation officers. The Juvenile
Courts in Porto Rico have original jurisdiction over
juvenile offenders, and any case appealed from the
Juvenile Courts may go directly to the Supreme Court
of the Island. The courts are courts of record and
the judges have authority to set the dates and places
when and where sessions of the court will be held, to
summon witnesses and compel them to appear in court.
The jurisdiction of the Juvenile Courts in Porto Rico
extends to all children under 16 years of age who are
accused of any crime whatsoever, and it also applies
to all people under 21 years of age, if they have ever
been under the jurisdiction of the Juvenile Court before
they were 16. The Juvenile Court also has jurisdiction
over adults who have been responsible for the
abandonment of children or who have contributed
in any way to the delinquency of the child.</p>

<p>Of course, this situation is not an ideal one for the
best working out of the problems that confront a
Juvenile Court system. In the first place, it is prac<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>tically
impossible for men who act as criminal judges
or criminal prosecutors to adopt the attitude so necessary
for the fulfillment of the work of a juvenile court
officer, as their training has been such as to influence
them to believe that the prisoner is an offender and
that violations of the law must be punished with sufficient
severity to prevent a repetition of the offense on
the part of the prisoner, and to serve as a warning for
others who might be tempted to commit the same
offense. The Juvenile Court officer, on the other hand,
should regard only the best future interests of the child,
and the question with him should not be as to whether
a proper punishment may be inflicted for what the
child has done, but as to how the future conduct of the
child may be bettered after a due consideration of all
the influences of heredity and environment in each
particular case.</p>

<p>From July 1, 1915, to January 1, 1916, a total of
164 cases came before the Juvenile Courts. Of these,
three cases were girls accused of petty larceny, and
two were charged with being abandoned. The remaining
159 cases were boys. The cause given in
nearly every case for the bad conduct of the children
was one of the four following:</p>

<p class="i2">
1. Lack of parental authority.<br />
2. Bad environment.<br />
3. Ignorance.<br />
4. Poverty<br />
</p>

<p>Of the total number, 83 boys were accused of larceny,
25 were abandoned children, 18 were accused of fighting,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
9 were accused of gambling, 7 were accused of breach
of the peace, 4 were accused of attempts at larceny,
3 were accused of stoning buildings, and the rest were
accused of various minor offenses.</p>

<p>An investigation of the home conditions of these
boys brings out some pertinent facts in connection
with the influence of a broken home upon the actions
of the children. Of the total number of cases presented,
21 lived with their parents, 54 lived with their
mothers, 23 lived with their fathers, and 22 lived with
relatives, 13 lived with guardians, 13 had absolutely
no homes and existed as best they might, with no
permanent dwelling place, while 8 lived with friends.
Thus we see that in the great majority of cases the
children came from homes where they lacked the
guidance and authority of at least one parent. Only
50 of the 164 had attended school, and only 15 had
succeeded in passing the third grade in the public
schools. Of the total number, 85 were illegitimate
children, and 15 did not know whether their parents
were married or not.</p>

<p>It is estimated that the city of San Juan alone has
500 homeless children and that there are at least
10,000 children in the Island who have absolutely no
home and who are entirely without the influence of
parental control. Doubtless, a great majority of these
children are the result of illegitimate unions. What
that means to the future of Porto Rico can very easily
be imagined when we consider that they are growing
up absolutely without control and without respect for
authority of any sort. In very few cases do they at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>tend
the public schools, and they must remain in this
homeless condition, living as best they can, stealing
or begging, when honest means of obtaining food do
not avail. Thus they grow up learning the vice that
can be found among the most poverty-stricken and
criminal classes with whom they associate, and forming
a group of people with criminal tendencies, and in their
turn causing to be produced another generation of
children who will be handicapped by the environment
and the training which their fathers have received.
The Government should colonize these homeless children
on government lands where they may be taught
a trade and where an attempt should be made to give
them some idea of what life may mean to the educated,
industrious citizen. The results would more than justify
the necessary expenditure of money.</p>

<p>The Juvenile Court in Porto Rico has three means
at its disposal for taking care of children that fall
under its jurisdiction. It may send them to the Reform
School at Mayaguez, in case they are boys.
(There is no Reform School for girls in the Island.) It
may also send them to one of the two charity schools
in existence, or it may place them under the supervision
of a friend or relative who must respond to the probation
officer for their good conduct. The Reform
School at Mayaguez will accommodate only 100 inmates,
and as these are usually required to complete
a rather long term of years in the institution, the number
of vacancies occurring in the school each year is
very small. The charity schools, both for boys and
girls, are also overcrowded, and there is very little
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
chance of the Juvenile Court being able to send any
of its cases to either of these institutions. As a result,
special wards have been prepared in the Insular penitentiary,
and the most serious cases are assigned to
these wards until such a time as there is a possibility of
their being placed in the Reform School. An attempt
is made to give the inmates of these special
wards industrial work and some academic instruction,
and they are kept absolutely separate from adult
prisoners.</p>

<p>Of the 164 cases mentioned, the following disposition
was made of the children: 34 were sent to correctional
institutions (most of these were sent to the
special wards in the penitentiary), 38 were placed
under the care of their mothers, 24 were placed under
the care of their fathers, 9 were placed under the care
of both parents, 8 under the care of friends, 12 under
the care of guardians, 17 under the care of relatives,
and 6 were sent to the charity schools.</p>

<p>The problem of juvenile offenders is more acute in
Porto Rico than in the United States, due to the fact
that there are more opportunities open in Porto Rico
for juvenile offenders than are to be found, possibly
with the exception of the largest cities, in the United
States. The early physical development of the tropics
adds to the difficulties of the situation, and also the
temptations that surround homeless children even at
a comparatively early age. In addition to this, we
have many instances of consensual marriages, which
offer a temptation to even the very young to lower the
standards of morality and to become careless regard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>ing
the marriage relation. The large number of
poverty-stricken and homeless undoubtedly contributes
a great deal to physical as well as mental and moral
degeneration, and the combination of these factors
may perhaps account for the large number of weak-minded
and insane that we find at large in the majority
of the towns of the Island. In addition, promiscuous
sexual relations undoubtedly contribute to this degeneracy,
and if active steps are not taken to prepare
these homeless children for better living and to enable
them to earn an honest living, they will serve as the
propagators of another generation of equally homeless,
pauperized, and degenerate citizens.</p>


<h2 id="RURAL_SCHOOLS">RURAL SCHOOLS</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">One</span> of the most perplexing problems which the
Department of Education has to face in Porto Rico
is the problem of the rural schools. In addition to a
school budget too small to provide the number of
rural schools necessary for all of the children of school
age, there are added difficulties in the way of poverty
and sickness among the country people which lead to
irregular attendance on the part of the children, poor
roads, and the keeping of children out of school in
order to help earn money to support the family, especially
in districts where child labor may be used profitably;
and above all these difficulties is the great
difficulty of furnishing the rural schools with teachers
who are adequately trained and who have a comprehensive
view of their mission as teachers and of the
duty of the school to the community in which it is
located.</p>

<p>The rural school problem will never be solved until
we are able to provide teachers who are thoroughly
prepared for the work which they have to do, and who
look upon this work as being as important as any other
profession. At present the rural school teachers fall
into two rather large classes: first, the young, inexperienced,
and often untrained teacher; and, second, the old,
often out-of-date teacher, who has been unable to keep
step with the progress of the town schools and has been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
pushed out into the country. Neither of these classes
is fitted to give the best instruction in the rural schools;
neither of them considers the position of a rural teacher
as a permanent one, and in order to accomplish his
best work the rural teacher should be expected to live
in one community for a term of years so that he may
fully understand and appreciate the problems of that
community and become thoroughly acquainted with
the patrons of his school.</p>

<p>The wages of the rural teacher should be such as will
enable him to live in comfort, and as part of his wages
the Government might very well assign him a parcel
of land, together with living quarters, which would
tend to make his residence in the district more permanent
and which would enable him to carry on
experimental work in agriculture at his own home.</p>

<p>There is no doubt but that the time will come when
consolidated schools will be established in each <i>barrio</i>
for the benefit of the children of the community. In
this way, better teachers, better school buildings,
better equipment, and a better arranged schedule of
studies can be provided, as an untrained teacher who
works with poor facilities and who has to handle two
different groups of children in the day and who may
have six grades to teach, is working under a disadvantage
which greatly handicaps the work. This is
especially true when the teacher has no permanent
interest in the rural school problem and regards his
term of office there simply as a stepping-stone to a
place in the graded school system of the town. In
the annual report of the Commissioner of Education<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
for 1914-15 we find the following data in regard to
the rural schools of Porto Rico:</p>

<p>"The rural schools are located in the <i>barrios</i> or
rural subdivisions of the municipalities. Of the
1,200,000 inhabitants which comprise the total population
of the Island, about 79 per cent live in this rural
area and about 70 per cent of them are illiterate. At
the present time there are approximately 331,233 children
of school age (between 5 and 18 years) living in
the barrios. Of these only 91,966 or 27 per cent were
enrolled in the rural schools at any time during the
past year. This shows a decrease from the figures
reported last year, but the fact is accounted for by an
order issued from the central office prohibiting rural
teachers from enrolling more than 80 pupils. In some
of the populous barrios the teachers were enrolling
150 pupils and sometimes more. Inasmuch as neither
the material conditions of the school buildings nor the
professional equipment of the teachers justified such
a burden, it was deemed wise, even in the face of an
overwhelming school population for which no provision
is made, to limit the enrollment to a size compatible
with a semblance of efficiency. The average number of
pupils belonging during the year to the rural schools
was 76,341. The average number of teachers at work
in these schools was 1,243. This figure includes a
number of teachers whose salary was paid by the
school boards from their surplus funds. The corps of
teachers for the entire Island is fixed by the legislature
each year when the appropriations to pay their salaries
are made, the commissioner being charged with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
its distribution among the various municipalities, but
the school boards may, within certain limitations, increase
the number allotted to them provided they pay
their salaries from any surplus funds at their disposal.
The average number of pupils taught by each teacher
was about 63. The average daily attendance was
69,786, or 89.7 per cent, which gives an average of
about 58 pupils receiving instruction daily from each
teacher. About 59 per cent of the pupils were boys
and 41 per cent girls. The average age of all pupils
in the rural schools was 10.1 years.</p>

<p>"The above figures show, in a way, the magnitude
of the problem to be solved before the people of Porto
Rico can assume in full the duties and privileges of
self-government. That enormous mass of illiterates,
in its primitive, uncured condition, is not safe timber
to build the good ship of state. We realize that there
are serious social and economic problems to be solved
before the people of Porto Rico reach the desired goal.
But the pioneer work must be done by the rural school.
Those people must be brought to a realization of their
condition and to wish to improve it. The rural school,
adapted more and more to actual conditions, is the
one agency that can bring this about. At present, we
are making provision for less than one third of the
rural school population. It is as if we had an enormous
debt and our resources did not permit us to pay the
interest on it. The problem calls for heroic measures.</p>

<p>"Of the 1,243 teachers in charge of the rural schools
during the past year, 1,217 or 91 per cent had double
enrollment, i.e., one group of 40 pupils or less in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
morning for three hours, and another similar group in
the afternoon for the same period. The distribution
of time among the various subjects of the curriculum
depends, of course, on whether the school has double
enrollment or not, as well as on the number of grades
grouped in any one session.</p>

<p>"The course of study of the rural schools extends
over a period of six years. Of the 91,966 different
pupils enrolled during the year, 49.1 per cent were
found in the first grade, 25.7 per cent in the second,
15.9 per cent in the third, 8.4 per cent in the fourth,
and the remaining 0.9 per cent in the fifth and sixth
grades. Of the total enrollment 93.2 per cent were
on half time, the remaining 6.8 per cent receiving instruction
six hours daily.</p>

<p>"Any enrichment of the rural course of study has
been necessarily conditioned by the meager professional
equipment of the rural teaching force, many of whom
entered the service with nothing more than a common-school
education and a few scraps of information about
school management gotten together for the examination.
Up to the present the academic requirements for
admission to the examinations for the rural license have
been limited to the eighth-grade diploma or its equivalent,
and the examinations for the obtention of the
license have covered the following subjects: English,
Spanish, arithmetic, history of the United States and
of Porto Rico, geography, elementary physiology and
hygiene, nature study, and methods of teaching. It
has been announced already that in all probability
candidates for the rural license will have to present
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
four high-school credits for admission to the examinations.
The excess of teachers now obtaining and the
increasing output of the Normal School will afford
opportunity for selection and will raise the standard
of efficiency of the force. At its last quarterly meeting
the board of trustees of the University of Porto
Rico voted to raise the entrance requirements of the
Normal Department from four high-school credits to
eight. In view of this, the Department of Education
will probably increase the requirements for admission
to the examinations for the rural license sufficiently to
bring them up to the standard established by the
board of trustees for admission to the Normal Department
of the University.</p>

<p>"The rural teachers are elected by the school boards,
subject to the approval of the Commissioner of Education,
who pays their salaries from an Insular appropriation.
The teachers are divided into three salary
classes, as follows: First class, $40; second class,
$45; third class, $50. All rural teachers begin at
the $40 salary, and after three years of experience
pass to the $45 class and after five years to the
$50 class. Last year all rural teachers received a
salary of $38 only, due to financial embarrassment.</p>

<p>"The rural schools were housed in 1,193 separate
buildings, containing a total of 1,250 classrooms. Of
these 1,193 rural buildings, 320 are owned by the
school boards and were especially constructed for
school purposes from plans approved by the Department
of Education and the sanitary officials. Most of
the rural school buildings contain but one room, al<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>though
not a few have two, three, and even four, the
tendency toward the centralized school growing
steadily. In all, 24 new rural school buildings have
been erected during the year. Most of these are
frame structures, but some are built of reÃ«nforced
concrete and have a very pleasing appearance."</p>


<h2 id="THE_SCHOOL_AND_THE_COMMUNITY">THE SCHOOL AND THE COMMUNITY</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> movement toward using the schoolhouse as
a center for the social activities of the community is
gaining ground every year and through this movement
the school, as an organization consisting of the teacher
and pupils, is rapidly coming to have much more influence
in the community life than was formerly the
case when the school was considered as merely an
organization for the teaching of academic subjects.
The need of a social center in the country districts is
especially marked, inasmuch as there is a decided tendency
among the country people to gather in small
groups, based upon relationship or intimate friendship,
to the exclusion of the wider interests of the community.
Little attempt is usually made to direct in any way the
outside activities or the recreation hours of the young
people and often their activities take a direction which
is distinctly unsocial.</p>

<p>The school in adapting itself to the community in
order that it may serve as a social center must make
certain investigations, because the need of social service
and the kind of service which shall be instituted,
depends upon existing local conditions. Some of the
most necessary lines of investigation to be made by
the teacher and pupils before the most effective aid
can be rendered, are those which follow:</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span></p>

<p>First.&mdash;The number of farmers who own the farms
upon which they live and the number of tenant farmers.</p>

<p>Second.&mdash;The average size of the farms; the number
of well-arranged homes; the total number of acres
devoted to each of the important crops.</p>

<p>Third.&mdash;The distance to the nearest market, and
the number of miles of well-kept roads.</p>

<p>These three points will determine largely the direction
which any social movement must take, because
upon them is based the economic situation of the community.
In addition to considering the community
from the economic point of view, we may also consider
the sanitary conditions that prevail in the district,
and the teacher and pupils should make a survey of
the district with the following points in mind:</p>

<p>First.&mdash;The sources of water supply. If water is
from open wells, where are they located, and what is
the distance from barns and outhouses; are they built
in accordance with specifications from the Department
of Sanitation?</p>

<p>Second.&mdash;How is garbage disposed of in the neighborhood;
are common drinking cups and the common
towel prohibited in the schoolroom? Is the school
furnished with a covered water tank, and does it have
facilities for washing the hands and face? Do the
people of the neighborhood know the regulations of
the Department of Sanitation in regard to sanitary
conditions; is there much preventable illness in the
district, and to what extent are patent medicines used
by the patrons of the school?</p>

<p>Third.&mdash;Are the houses, including the schoolhouses,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
well ventilated and well located as far as distance from
standing water or other mosquito-breeding places is
concerned? Is the floor of the schoolhouse swept
every night, and are foot scrapers and doormats provided?
Does the teacher inspect the outhouses, and
are they built according to specifications from the
Department of Sanitation?</p>

<p>A union of all the patrons of the district is necessary
if any movement is to be carried out with telling effect,
and the teacher should find out if there is or has been
any organization of the men, women, girls, or boys in
the district of a social or civic type; has the school
done anything up to the present time to improve the
social life in the district, and has it ever encouraged
local fairs or exhibits of school or agricultural products,
and has it founded boys' or girls' agricultural or home
economics clubs?</p>

<p>How does the religious condition affect the community,
and what is the attitude of the community
toward these matters and toward social affairs? How
do the young men and young women spend their
leisure time? Has the school any magazines or farm
papers in its library, and how many homes in the district
have any library, or any musical instruments?</p>

<p>What has been the attitude of the previous teachers
in the district toward the affairs of the community;
how long has each remained in the district? Are
changes in the position of the teachers frequent, and
if so, what is the reason? Have previous teachers
actually resided in the community or have they lived
in the nearest town? Have the previous teachers
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
been professionally trained, and have they taken any
interest in the affairs of the community outside of
their regular school duties?</p>

<p>When the school has succeeded in getting together
the information noted in the above paragraphs, it will
then be in a position to determine what lines of social
activity will be best for the particular community.</p>

<p>The organization of men's clubs and women's clubs
for the discussion of topics of general interest and for
the purpose of arousing a feeling of community interest
should be undertaken as soon as possible, the
teacher always remembering that the management of
these organizations should be in the hands of the members
who compose them, and that the teacher should
act only as an adviser in case advice may be necessary.
The people should feel that on them rests the responsibility
of developing the civic and social life of the
community, and the teacher should not allow them to
shift this responsibility. The organization of boys'
clubs and girls' clubs will present no difficulties to the
teacher who has made a study of the situation and
who is prepared for his work. The boys and girls are
in the most easily influenced period of their lives, and
whether or not they will develop a sense of civic and
social responsibility, depends very largely upon the
attitude which their teachers take in regard to these
matters.</p>

<p>Rural life in any community has a tendency to be
monotonous and deadening to the finer qualities. Uninterrupted
and unduly prolonged physical labor tends
to the detriment of both the physical and the mental
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
abilities of the individual. The isolation of the country
home tends to narrow and restrict social intercourse,
and the difficulty of travel and communication increases
the monotony of country life. These circumstances
do a great deal to offset the advantage of
living in the country and have contributed a great
deal to the stigma that has always been attached to
the countryman.</p>

<p>If there is to be any reform in this isolated social
life of the community, the reform must come about
through the schools. The Government can aid to a
great extent through the provision of well-kept roads
and by the establishment of means of communication
such as the telephone and the telegraph. The man
who is in touch with the large affairs of life forgets
his own petty annoyances in the contemplation of
problems of greater importance, while the man who
has nothing to think about except the annoyances of
his own life tends to become self-centered and narrow.</p>

<p>Rural social center work in the United States has
made great progress within the last few years and has
been successful in practically all the places where it
has been tried, especially if the teacher is a person of
tact and intelligence. A great deal depends upon the
attitude which the teacher has in this work, and it is
not enough that the teacher should undertake such
work as a burden added to the already overcrowded
curriculum of the day, but the teacher should enter
into the movement with a sincere desire to improve
the condition of the community and bring the patrons
of the district to a higher degree of efficiency as work<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>men
and as citizens. In every community there are
many young women and young men who are above
the average school age who are compelled to work
during the day, and who are fast becoming fixed in
the monotonous life that has surrounded the older
people of the community, who might easily be interested
by the teacher and influenced through the formation
of social clubs, so that they would form the
nucleus for a better coming generation of citizens.
The meetings of young people should partake of recreation
as well as of serious study, and while the
avowed intention of new clubs formed by the school
should be for the purpose of bettering the social and
civic condition of the people of the community, they
must be placed in as favorable a light as possible, for
it should be remembered that people will often undertake
a movement which will have decidedly beneficial
results if it is disguised under the form of recreation,
when they would hesitate to give their continued
assistance to such a movement if it partook entirely
of the nature of serious study.</p>

<p>The Department of Education in the Island of Porto
Rico is making a special effort at the present time to
interest the older girls and the women of the towns
in social betterment through the medium of mothers'
clubs and girls' clubs, organized under the direction
of the teachers of home economics. These clubs have
been organized in practically all of the towns of the
Island and are meeting with general success. In
many cases the girls' clubs assume an aspect of economic
improvement in that they undertake the pro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>duction
of certain salable articles such as embroidery
or handwork, and the teacher in charge of the group
provides the market for the articles produced. Little
has been done up to the present in organizing the men
and boys into social groups. Boy scout organizations
were widely established through the Island several
years ago, but on account of the lack of some individual
to devote his time to the organizing side of the
movement they have decreased in number and in
influence. Anyone who is at all familiar with the
social situation in Porto Rico, especially in the rural
districts, will see at once the necessity of organizations
of the kind mentioned above and will be impressed
with the possibilities for good in a community which
can be exercised by the rural school under the direction
of an efficient, well trained, enthusiastic teacher.
The democratic form of government which the Island
enjoys demands the highest possible development of
civic and social ideas and obligations, and in order to
fulfill its highest mission the school should undertake
such lines of work as will tend to develop not only
better educated people of academic attainments, but
also better trained citizens in the social and civic sense.</p>


<h2 id="RELATION_OF_THE_TEACHER_TO_THE">RELATION OF THE TEACHER TO THE
COMMUNITY</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">In</span> rural sections the school should be a factor of
much more importance than it is in the urban centers
for the reason that the country people are almost entirely
shut off from other educative institutions such as
public libraries, free lectures, and association with their
fellow-citizens, privileges which the urban resident is
able to use to great advantage. To carry out effectively
the mission of the rural school in a community
and to make it a center from which there may be
spread an influence for social betterment, as well as
for intellectual improvement, the teacher is the all-important
factor. There are certain duties which a
teacher owes to his profession, in case he is working
in the country, which cannot be neglected if he is to
obtain the results which he should obtain. Following
are some of the most important of these duties:</p>

<p>First.&mdash;The teacher should visit all homes and get
acquainted with the patrons. This is important in
order that he may get an insight into the conditions
under which the people are living, and that he may
know the particular difficulties of the pupils with
whom he has to deal. Moreover, acquaintance on
the part of the parents with the teacher will often aid
in avoiding disciplinary difficulties, inasmuch as the
parents come to have increasing confidence in him
and his work as their acquaintance with him increases.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>

<p>Second.&mdash;The teacher should study conditions from
all angles so as to adapt the school work to the needs
of the community. Even in so small an island as
Porto Rico, we have distinctly different occupations
centered in different parts of the Island, and the
teacher should remember that the majority of his
pupils will undoubtedly grow up to take a part in the
prevailing industry of the community in which they
are born and raised. The schedule and work of the
rural school should not be an attempt to imitate the
plan of study of the urban schools, inasmuch as
the problems are entirely different, and until a teacher
has convinced himself of this fact and has made an
attempt to model his work on the needs of the community,
the school will not accomplish its full mission.</p>

<p>Third.&mdash;The teacher should live in the district
seven days in the week during the school term. More
and more the idea is becoming prevalent that rural
teachers should be provided with a house and a small
plot of ground near the school in order to become
permanent residents of the district. The average
farmer is very conservative and needs visual demonstration
of the merits of new ideas before he will accept
them. No amount of theoretical teaching will improve
farming conditions to any great extent, and unless
the teacher is able to become a demonstrator of his
ideas by actually putting them into practice on the
plot of ground which he himself manages, he cannot
expect to influence to any great extent the agricultural
movements of the community in which he works.
The school should aim not only for the education of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
the children who are actually enrolled, but also for
the betterment of the agricultural and social conditions
of the community.</p>

<p>Fourth.&mdash;The rural teacher should be loyal to his
pupils and patrons. The teacher who feels himself
an individual superior to the members of the community
whom he is serving and allows this feeling to express
itself in his attitude toward them, loses the greater part
of his influence through this action. The countryman
likes to be met on equal terms and does not enjoy
a condescending attitude any more than does his
brother who lives in the town. The teacher should
have in mind only the benefits which he may bring
to the community, and if he actually and actively
takes part in the social movements of the place he
will come to learn that human nature is the same in
the country as in the town, and he will be able to
acquire a sincere liking for the people with whom he
works.</p>

<p>Fifth.&mdash;The teacher should so conduct himself
outside of the school as to win respect for himself and
for his profession. The idea that a teacher's duty to
the school ends with the closing of the actual school
day is a mistaken one. Any action on the part of the
teacher outside of his school work which would tend
to lower him in the estimation of his pupils or their
parents, inevitably tends to reduce the amount of
influence which he can exert. A teacher is on duty
constantly and cannot limit his working hours or his
working habits to certain defined periods of time.</p>

<p>Sixth.&mdash;The teacher should stay more than one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
year in a district, unless a change means decided professional
and financial advancement. Short term
teachers are often of more harm than benefit to the
children of a community. The advent of a new
teacher means a change in plans and usually a change
in methods of work. These changes tend to upset
the minds of the children who naturally like to follow
well-defined lines of work. The constant change
of teachers also means that none of them stays
sufficiently long to learn the needs of the community
and the best method of meeting these needs. School
boards should offer inducements to rural teachers in
the way of increasing the salary for increased length of
service, and thus there would be less desire on the
part of the teacher to move from one district to
another.</p>

<p>Seventh.&mdash;The teacher should arouse an interest in
the school and do his part to convince the patrons of
the need of a better school to meet the demands of the
present day. A great part of the teacher's work lies
outside of his actual teaching, and more and more we
are coming to conceive the school as a social as well
as an educational institution, and by means of parents'
meetings, using the school as a social center and making
the schoolhouse a gathering place for the patrons of
the district, where they may meet and discuss the
problems with which they are confronted, the present-day
teacher supplements his actual teaching duties.
There are few other ways in which the social needs of the
country people can be better met than through the
rural school. Moreover, by means of these meetings
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
it is possible to show parents the progress which is
being made by their children in the school work and
to impress them with the necessity of regular and punctual
attendance. One of the surest ways to win the
approval of men and women is by interesting them in
the progress of their children, and the wise teacher
will take advantage of every opportunity which presents
itself, and go to great lengths to make opportunities
for cultivating the interest of the parents in
the school, through this means.</p>

<p>Eighth.&mdash;The teacher in a rural school should have
as the aim of rural education "better men, better
farming, and better living." The country teacher who
appreciates and realizes this is aware of the chief factors
in the solution of the farm problem. He must
also remember that he is a public servant and that the
public has a right to expect him to put his whole soul
into the welfare of the community. The schools are
held to be largely responsible for ineffective farming
and the low ideals of country life. A great many of
our rural teachers are not at all in sympathy with
rural ideals and rural customs. They regard their
position as merely temporary, and express, even though
it may be involuntary on their part, the idea that the
town is much preferable to the country, and in this
way inculcate in the children a distaste for the life of
the country, when it should be their duty to present the
best features of rural life in order to persuade the
children to remain on the farms.</p>

<p>Ninth.&mdash;The teacher should be able to discriminate
between essentials and non-essentials and omit the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
latter, thus giving more time to the problems of country
life. He should get away from the formalism of textbooks,
using them only as tools, and adapt all his work
to the needs and interests of the community. He
should not attempt to be too scientific, but should
teach in terms of child life. And even in his intercourse
with the patrons of the school he should put
himself, in manners and conversation, on terms of
equality with them. The teacher should learn to use
his energy for better and more definite planning, and
in the schoolroom should do for the children fewer of
those things that may be done by the pupils themselves.
There is no reason why pupils should not be taught
to study and work independently, and the school that
fulfills its highest mission trains children to become
independent workers. Especially is this true in the
country, where pupils should work as well as study
and recite. Mere academic training in the rural school
will defeat the purpose of the school and will be very
apt to produce young men and young women who are
dissatisfied with the conditions under which they must
live after leaving school.</p>


<h2 id="PRESENT-DAY_RURAL_SCHOOL">PRESENT-DAY RURAL SCHOOL
MOVEMENTS</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Within</span> the last few years, rural education in the
United States has received a great deal of attention,
and many plans have been suggested for the betterment
of rural teaching. Conferences of state and
national educators have been held for the purpose of
discussing the rural school question, and out of the
mass of school movements, discussions, and ideas
which have been presented, there are some which might
be made applicable to the situation as it exists in
Porto Rico.</p>

<p>The following ideas seem to indicate the spirit which
underlies rural education of the present day. They are
the result of a conference held in Kentucky in 1914 by
people who were especially interested in rural school
problems:</p>

<p>First.&mdash;The greatest social need of the century is
the organization and consequent up-building of the
rural life of America.</p>

<p>Second.&mdash;This must be the outgrowth of the self-activity
of rural life forces.</p>

<p>Third.&mdash;Outside forces can only assist in the work.</p>

<p>Fourth.&mdash;There is a need of raising the general level
of living in the country in order to keep the brightest
and best people from leaving the country in too great
numbers.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>

<p>Fifth.&mdash;To educate the young in the schools, to
elevate their ideals, to arouse their ambitions without
raising the level of living and offering them a broader
field for the exercise of their talents, may do as much
harm as good.</p>

<p>Sixth.&mdash;The school is only one of the agencies for
community up-building.</p>

<p>Seventh.&mdash;There must be coÃ¶peration among the
rural life forces, all working together for a common end.</p>

<p>Eighth.&mdash;The farmer, the country woman, the
country teacher, the country editor, the country doctor,
and the country business man must all join hands
for better living along every line in the country.</p>

<p>Ninth.&mdash;The community is the proper unit for
rural development.</p>

<p>Tenth.&mdash;The community must learn how to educate,
to organize, and to develop itself.</p>

<p>In attempting to carry out the ideas expressed in
the statements quoted above, emphasis has been laid
upon educational rallies, school farms, farmers' Chatauquas,
and other means which have as their aim the
idea of arousing community pride and community
coÃ¶peration, not only for the benefit and betterment
of the school, but also for the benefit and betterment of
the members of the community who are not of school
age. A great deal of emphasis has been laid upon
rural school extension work, that is, work carried on
under the supervision of school officers but which really
devotes its main efforts to adults who are living in
rural communities. One of the most recent steps in
this direction was the passing of the bill known as the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
"Smith Lever Act" by the Federal Congress in 1914,
which ultimately carries with it an appropriation of
over $4,500,000 for agricultural extension and rural
welfare. Under this bill, Porto Rico receives $10,000
per year for extension work among the farmers, the
work being carried out under the supervision of the
Federal Experiment Station located at Mayaguez.</p>

<p>Another movement which is prominent in rural school
affairs at present, is the tendency toward a larger unit
of organization for taxation and administration. The
rural schools of Porto Rico are already under the
municipal unit of school administration, which probably
will not be changed, as close supervision demands
rather small units of organization. In the report of the
Commissioner of Education for 1915-16 a suggestion
is made that the appropriation of money for schools
throughout the Island be determined by the school
population in a given community and not by the taxable
wealth of that community. It frequently happens
that the wealthiest municipalities are the ones which
are least in need of additional school facilities, and
this recommendation tends to make the unit for school
taxation and appropriation of funds an Insular rather
than a municipal unit, as we have to-day. The idea,
of course, is based upon the fact that Porto Rico is
small enough so that every citizen should be interested
in the education of all the children of the Island, and
that the movements in education should be Insular in
unit rather than municipal.</p>

<p>Demonstration schools for rural communities have
been organized with a view to showing the people in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
a definite and concrete way what a school can do for
a community. These demonstration schools are usually
placed in a central location and put under the
charge of the teachers of greatest experience and ability.
All of the children in the different grades included in
the rural school course have a course of study to complete
in the schoolroom, and another equally emphasized
course of study to complete in the home and on
the farm.</p>

<p>Experiments and studies are being carried on which
involve the use of every day throughout the year. To
accomplish this end, the father and mother have become
the assistant supervisors of the home work and
the farm work, and they receive the advice, the suggestion,
and the instruction of the rural supervisors of
schools. While working to get the best possible results
from the efforts made, and to establish the facts
by samples, by photographs, and by financial relations
of cost and return, these undertakings are accompanied
by neighborhood meetings of many kinds which have
had the effect of enlarging community interest, community
support, and community improvement. Out
of these efforts have come better social conditions,
more harmonious relations, a development of better
ideals, and a higher conception of life.</p>

<p>These demonstration schools, in addition to being
a force among the people in the community where
they are located, also serve as educational centers
which are to be visited by the other rural teachers
of the community in order that the inexperienced
and untrained teacher may receive the benefit of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
teacher of more experience. In addition, these schools
also serve the purpose of experimental schools where
many ideas are worked out and put into effect, and new
methods of teaching as well as untried methods of
farming are given a trial.</p>

<p>The rural school situation is being studied more to-day
than ever before, for it is being realized that our
country schools are not functioning to the best advantage.
The social side of the task, extension work
among the patrons of the district, consolidated and
more efficient schools, and better trained teachers are
only a few of the phases of this movement toward
making the rural school a real force throughout the
country. The movement is gaining ground each year,
and though there are many problems to be solved and
many difficult situations to be met, yet there is every
reason to believe that out of this mass of experiments
there will evolve the rural school of the future, which
will be a more vital factor in the community than has
been the case up to the present day.</p>



<h2 id="PHYSICAL_DEVELOPMENT_AND">PHYSICAL DEVELOPMENT AND
LONGEVITY</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> anthropometric examinations given in the
University of Porto Rico during the last two years
have provided data from which to determine the physical
development of the Porto Rican. A total of 1,412
examinations has been made, including 616 men and
796 women. These students ranged in age from
fifteen to thirty years.</p>

<p>A comparison of the physical development of American
and Porto Rican boys and girls of the same age
shows that the Porto Rican surpasses the American in
nearly every point, at the ages of fifteen, sixteen, and
seventeen. At eighteen the physical development is
about the same, but from that time there seems to be
little additional growth on the part of the Porto Rican,
while the American continues to develop up to and
including the twenty-second year. This seems to
confirm the generally accepted theory that a person
matures earlier in the tropics than he does in a temperate
climate. That the slighter physical development
is the effect of geographic or climatic conditions,
and is not entirely due to race, is proved by the fact
that measurements of Chilean boys, who are of Spanish
blood, more nearly approximate those of North
American boys than they do those of Porto Ricans.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
The following tables show a comparison of the development
of the Porto Rican students with the average
development of American men and women. The
measurements are in pounds and inches.</p>

<p>A study of the census of 1910 showing the distribution
of the population of Porto Rico by race and by
age periods gives some interesting information. If
the situation given there is taken to be typical of general
conditions, by considering the number of children
of each class under one year of age, we find that the
highest birth rate is among the mulattoes; next in order
come the native whites of native parentage, next the
blacks, and last the native whites of foreign or mixed
parentage. The actual percentage of each class under
one year of age is as follows: mulattoes, 3.9 per cent;
native whites of native parentage, 3.6 per cent; blacks,
2.5 per cent; native whites of foreign or mixed parentage,
2 per cent. The percentage of the population
under five years of age in each class tends to confirm
this statement. It is as follows: mulattoes 17.9 per<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
cent; native whites of native parentage, 14.7 per cent;
blacks, 12.2 per cent; native whites of foreign or
mixed parentage, 9.5 per cent.</p>

<p>While the mulattoes have the highest birth rate, it
is also true that, as a general thing, they are the shortest
lived of any of the classes mentioned. The class
which generally has greatest longevity consists of the
negroes; next in order come the native whites of mixed
or foreign parentage, then the native whites of native
parentage, and last, the mulattoes. Thus the order,
as regards length of life, is nearly the reverse of what
it is as regards birth rate.</p>

<p>It is observed also that while native whites of foreign
or mixed parentage have a comparatively great
length of life and a comparatively low birth rate, their
children, who fall in the class of native whites of native
parentage, have shorter lives and tend to produce larger
families, than did the parents. In each class the
females outnumber the males, the proportion being
100 females to 99.4 males for the total population,
which, however, includes the foreign-born whites,
where the males outnumber the females. In the classes
of native-born citizens, the difference between the
numbers of the sexes is greater than the ratio for the
total population would indicate, being the greatest
among the mulattoes, where the ratio is 93.6 males for
every 100 females. In each class it is found that the
women enjoy greater length of life than do the men.</p>

<p>The following table shows what proportion of the
total number of each class of the population falls under
the age groups designated.</p>

<p>It will be noticed that above the age of 55 there is
a larger proportion of women than men in each class.
Judging the median age for each group to be the year
which divides the total number of that group into two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
equal divisions, so far as number is concerned, we find
the following median ages: blacks, 23; mulattoes, 18;
native whites of native parentage, 20; native whites
of foreign or mixed parentage, 22; foreign-born whites,
37. These results correspond exactly with the statements
previously made regarding the longevity of
each group. This would, of course, only give the
median age for each class at the time the census was
taken, in 1910, but as practically the same age distribution
is also found in the census of 1899, it may be concluded
that the results are approximately correct.
This means that 50 per cent of each group does not
live beyond the age indicated, and is sometimes known
as the "mean length of life." Data for calculating
the average length of life are not available.</p>

<p>A comparison of the age groups in the United States
and in Porto Rico shows that the proportion in the
younger ages is greater in Porto Rico than it is in the
United States.</p>

Undoubtedly the work of the Department of Sanitation
and of the Institute of Tropical Medicine will do
much to change the death rate within the next few
years, and to prolong life. We may well expect the
next census to show a much larger percentage of the
population in the higher age groups.</p>

have legitimate wives also have consensual wives or mistresses.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> author of this series knows children and their interests;
schools and their possibilities; pedagogy and its lessons;
nature, literature and art, and their resources in education.
The series has individuality. Beginning with live phonics and
vivid drama, it includes fairy and folk lore, games, stories of
school activities, of primitive life, of nature, of child life in other
lands, dramatizations, and a wealth of standard literature that
appeals to the growing child.</p>

<p class="i2"><i>Bertha M. Bentley, Primary Supervisor, Speyer School, Teachers College, Columbia University</i>:
I have examined the Haliburton Readers quite thoroughly and find them very
satisfactory. For readers built upon a phonic scheme they are far ahead of most readers
of that sort. The material is literary in character and interesting to children.</p>

<p class="i2"><i>Ann Beers, Supervising Principal, Jefferson School, Washington, D. C.</i>: The Haliburton
Readers are striking in many ways: in binding, in type, in paper, in illustration, in arrangement,
in subject matter, in suggestion, in vocabulary, and in many other delightful
matters. One can say most emphatically that these books make an inestimably valuable
acquisition to the reading matter of a school system. I can also report the very earnest
approval of the books by the teachers of some of my best schools.</p>

and continues through the period of discovery and exploration.
A vivid account of the things best worth knowing about the Greeks,
the Romans, the development of civilization in Europe, and its transplanting
in America, is made of interest to sixth grade classes. The
pupil is led to understand that the early settlers from England, Spain,
Holland, and France brought with them the arts of civilized life and
government they had learned in the countries from which they came.

<h3>HISTORY OF THE UNITED STATES</h3>

<p class="center"><i>By</i> <span class="smcap">Henry E. Bourne</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">E. J. Benton</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Prominence</span> is given to economic and social history and to the
great westward movement; military details are subordinate;
matters of mere traditional value have been eliminated, thus leaving
space for a more full treatment of matters of present importance. The
book is pre-eminently fitted to prepare pupils now in grammar schools
for intelligent entrance upon the duties of citizenship. It is noteworthy
that the authors have included an adequate treatment of the West,
which previous books have generally neglected. The treatment of the
South is sympathetic and informing. The book is unique. This judgment
applies not only to the form in which it is presented, but also to
the type of service that it renders to the rising generation.</p>
